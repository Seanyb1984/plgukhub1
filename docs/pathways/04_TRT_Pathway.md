# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-004 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical management of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. TRT is prescribed for men with clinically confirmed testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS) — defined by biochemically low testosterone combined with a symptomatic androgen-deficient clinical picture.

**Regulatory status:** Testosterone preparations are **Schedule 4 Part II Controlled Drugs (CDs)** under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, and **Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs)** under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. This places TRT in the most regulated prescribing category operated within this clinic group.

**Prescribing model:** The Manchester Medical Director (MD) is the **sole prescriber** for all testosterone preparations at all Menhancements clinic locations. No testosterone product may be ordered, held, prepared, or administered at any clinic without a valid MD prescription on the patient's digital record. Treating Practitioners at Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan administer the prescribed treatment but do not prescribe, adjust doses, or modify treatment routes independently.

**Programme structure:** TRT is an ongoing treatment programme — not a single procedure. It requires mandatory biochemical baseline investigations before initiation, a structured diagnostic assessment, MD prescribing consultation, treatment delivery, and a formal monitoring schedule at 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter. Each monitoring review is conducted or directly overseen by the MD, who retains prescribing authority at every stage.

**Clinical foundation:** All prescribing decisions are made in accordance with the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM) Guidelines on Adult Testosterone Deficiency (2022), Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (2018), and relevant NHS England clinical policy.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REGULATORY NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — CONTROLLED DRUG STATUS**
> Testosterone preparations are Schedule 4 Part II Controlled Drugs. All storage, prescribing, dispensing, and administration must comply with the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations 1973 (as applicable). The Manchester MD is the responsible prescriber for all CD prescriptions in this pathway. No testosterone product is to be administered from clinic stock without a valid, patient-specific, MD-signed prescription on the digital record.

> **NOTICE 2 — DIAGNOSTIC THRESHOLD IS MANDATORY**
> TRT must not be initiated on the basis of symptoms alone. Two separate early-morning fasting serum testosterone samples, taken on different days, must confirm biochemical testosterone deficiency before the MD prescribes. Initiating TRT without confirmed biochemical deficiency is a serious clinical governance breach.

> **NOTICE 3 — PSA MANDATORY BEFORE FIRST PRESCRIPTION**
> A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test is absolutely mandatory before TRT is initiated. TRT is contraindicated in men with known or suspected prostate carcinoma. Administering TRT without a baseline PSA on file is a patient safety breach.

> **NOTICE 4 — FERTILITY COUNSELLING IS MANDATORY**
> TRT suppresses endogenous testosterone production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, causing oligospermia or azoospermia in the majority of treated men. All patients must receive documented counselling on the fertility impact of TRT before the first prescription is issued. Men wishing to preserve fertility must be referred for appropriate management (e.g., HCG co-therapy, sperm banking) before commencing TRT.

## 1.2 Licensed Products & Formulations

> Product selection is exclusively the MD's clinical decision. The Practitioner does not select or substitute products.

### Intramuscular Injectable Testosterone (Practitioner-Administered at Clinic)

| Product | Formulation | Licensed Dose | Injection Interval | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nebido** (Bayer) | Testosterone undecanoate 1,000 mg/4 mL | 1,000 mg IM | Loading: Week 0 + Week 6; Maintenance: every 10–14 weeks | 4 mL — must be injected over minimum 2 minutes |

| **Testim** (Ferring) | Testosterone 50 mg/5 g tube | 50–100 mg daily | Shoulders or upper arms |

> Gel patients must be counselled on transfer risk: gel must be fully dry before skin contact with others, particularly women of childbearing age and children.

---

## 1.3 Diagnostic Criteria — TRT Must Not Be Initiated Without All Three

### Criterion 1 — Symptomatic Androgen Deficiency

Patient must present with clinically significant symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Standard validated tools must be completed:

| Tool | Positive Screen |
|---|---|
| **ADAM Questionnaire** (Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males) — 10 questions | Positive if Q1 or Q7 = Yes, OR any 3 other questions = Yes |
| **AMS Scale** (Aging Males' Symptoms) — 17 questions | Moderate–severe: score ≥37 |
| **IIEF-5** (Erectile Function domain) | Score ≤21 (any degree of erectile dysfunction) — supporting evidence |

### Criterion 2 — Biochemical Confirmation (Mandatory)

- **Two separate early-morning fasting serum testosterone samples**, collected between 07:00 and 10:00, on two different days, at minimum 1 week apart
- **Both samples must be analysed by the same accredited laboratory**
- **Diagnostic thresholds (BSSM 2022):**

| Total Testosterone | Clinical Action |
|---|---|
| **< 8 nmol/L** | TRT indicated — initiate after contraindication screen and investigations |
| **8–12 nmol/L** | TRT indicated if symptomatic AND (low SHBG OR low calculated free testosterone <0.225 nmol/L) — MD clinical judgement required |
| **> 12 nmol/L** | TRT unlikely to be beneficial — MD to review, consider alternative diagnoses |

### Criterion 3 — Exclusion of Contraindications and Mandatory Investigations Completed

All absolute and relative contraindications screened (Section 1.4). All baseline investigations completed and reviewed by MD (Section 1.5). No initiation before all three criteria are confirmed.

---

## 1.4 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TRT MUST NOT BE INITIATED OR CONTINUED

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Known or suspected prostate carcinoma | TRT drives prostate cancer progression — absolute prohibition |
| Known or suspected male breast cancer | Androgen-sensitive tumour — absolute prohibition |
| PSA >4.0 ng/mL without urological investigation and clearance | May indicate occult prostate malignancy |
| Haematocrit >54% at baseline | Polycythaemia — thrombosis risk before further elevation by TRT |
| Haemoglobin >185 g/L at baseline | As above |
| Severe, uncontrolled heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) | Fluid retention may worsen cardiac decompensation |
| Untreated severe obstructive sleep apnoea | TRT can exacerbate OSA — may trigger respiratory emergencies |
| Hypersensitivity to testosterone or any excipient of the prescribed product | Anaphylaxis risk |
| Patient under 18 years of age | Not licensed; endocrine development concerns |
| Secondary hypogonadism of pituitary origin — pituitary adenoma not excluded | Must exclude pituitary pathology before initiating TRT; refer to endocrinology |
| Elevated prolactin (>600 mIU/L) without investigation | May indicate prolactinoma — suppress prolactin first |

### Relative Contraindications — MD ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTED DECISION REQUIRED

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Desire for fertility (current or anticipated) | Mandatory fertility counselling; consider HCG co-therapy or sperm banking before TRT; document decision |
| PSA 3.0–4.0 ng/mL | Urology opinion before initiation; enhanced PSA monitoring on treatment |
| Benign prostatic hyperplasia with significant lower urinary tract symptoms | Urological assessment; TRT may worsen LUTS |
| Cardiovascular disease (recent MI, stroke <6 months, or active unstable angina) | Cardiology review; individualised benefit-risk assessment by MD |
| Treated, stable obstructive sleep apnoea | Proceed with enhanced monitoring; CPAP compliance confirmed |
| Active liver disease or elevated LFTs | MD review; injectable and topical forms preferred over oral; recheck LFTs at 3 months |
| Thrombophilia or history of VTE | Haematology review; thrombosis risk elevated by polycythaemia effect of TRT |
| Metastatic bone disease | Potential acceleration of bone metastases — oncology review essential |
| Haematocrit 50–54% | Proceed at reduced dose with enhanced haematocrit monitoring |
| BMI >35 | Increased aromatisation to oestradiol; elevated cardiovascular risk; enhanced monitoring |
| Significant psychiatric disorder including active depression | TRT has mood effects — psychiatric co-management recommended |

---

## 1.5 Mandatory Baseline Investigations

> **All investigations must be completed and results reviewed by the MD before the first TRT prescription is issued.** The Practitioner collects the baseline investigation request from the MD, communicates it to the patient, and ensures results are uploaded to the digital record before the prescribing consultation.

### Required Before Every First Prescription

| Investigation | Why Mandatory |
|---|---|
| **Serum total testosterone** (×2, fasting, early morning — separate days) | Diagnostic confirmation; both samples required |
| **SHBG** (sex hormone binding globulin) | Allows calculation of free testosterone; low SHBG elevates free T at borderline total T |
| **Calculated free testosterone** | Sensitive diagnostic marker when total T is borderline 8–12 nmol/L |
| **LH** (luteinising hormone) | Distinguishes primary (high LH) from secondary (low/normal LH) hypogonadism |
| **FSH** (follicle-stimulating hormone) | Fertility assessment; azoospermia risk context |
| **Prolactin** | Exclude hyperprolactinaemia / prolactinoma before diagnosing hypogonadism |
| **PSA** (prostate-specific antigen) | **Mandatory** — exclude prostate carcinoma before initiating TRT |
| **FBC** (full blood count with haematocrit) | Baseline haematocrit / haemoglobin — TRT raises both |
| **LFTs** (liver function tests) | Baseline hepatic function |
| **Lipid profile** (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides) | Cardiovascular risk profiling; TRT can affect lipid profile |
| **HbA1c** | Metabolic baseline; TDS is associated with insulin resistance |
| **Oestradiol** (E2) | Baseline aromatisation; critical for ongoing monitoring |
| **Blood pressure** | Cardiovascular baseline |
| **Thyroid function (TSH)** | Exclude thyroid disorder as a cause of symptoms before attributing to TDS |
| **ADAM questionnaire result** | Validated symptom baseline — documented on consultation form |
| **AMS Scale result** | Validated symptom baseline — documented on consultation form |
| **IIEF-5 score** (if erectile dysfunction is a presenting symptom) | Validated baseline — documented |

### Additional Investigations — MD to Request if Clinically Indicated

| Investigation | Indication |
|---|---|
| Karyotype (47,XXY — Klinefelter's) | If primary hypogonadism with no clear cause, small testes, azoospermia |
| Pituitary MRI | If LH/FSH low AND prolactin elevated or no clear cause for secondary hypogonadism |
| DRE (digital rectal examination) | If PSA 3.0–4.0 ng/mL or lower urinary tract symptoms; performed by MD or urologist |
| Bone mineral density (DXA scan) | If long-standing TDS (>5 years) suspected — osteoporosis risk |
| Sleep study / Epworth Sleepiness Scale | If OSA suspected |
| Semen analysis | If fertility concern raised |
| Scrotal ultrasound | If testicular abnormality on examination |

## 1.7 Prescribing & Consultation Pathway

### THE MANCHESTER MD IS THE SOLE PRESCRIBER FOR ALL TESTOSTERONE AT ALL CLINICS

---

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 30–45 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Records presenting symptoms using ADAM, AMS, and IIEF-5 validated questionnaires
2. Takes full medical history — with particular attention to cardiovascular, prostate, hepatic, and haematological history
3. Records all current medications, supplements (including anabolic steroids — common in this patient demographic; flag immediately to MD)
4. Records blood pressure
5. Screens all absolute and relative contraindications (Section 1.4)
6. Confirms baseline investigations have been requested or are on file. If not — issues investigation request form to patient and defers prescribing consultation until results are available
7. **Does NOT prescribe testosterone or any CD/POM**
8. **Does NOT administer any testosterone product**
9. Transmits completed assessment, questionnaire results, and investigation results to Manchester MD for prescribing consultation

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation (standard for Leeds/Wilmslow/Wigan) OR in-person (Manchester)
**Mandatory for:** All new TRT patients and all monitoring-triggered dose reviews
**Timing:** After all baseline investigations are reviewed

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner's assessment, all baseline investigation results, and questionnaire scores
2. Applies the three-point diagnostic criteria (Section 1.3) — documents met/not met explicitly
3. Conducts independent clinical consultation with patient — history, symptoms, goals, lifestyle
4. Excludes all absolute contraindications
5. Reviews and documents relative contraindications and their management plan
6. Conducts mandatory fertility counselling — documents patient's confirmed understanding of HPG axis suppression, its effect on spermatogenesis, and any decisions regarding sperm banking or HCG co-therapy
7. Selects treatment route (IM injection vs. topical gel) and specific product based on patient profile
8. Determines starting dose and injection interval or gel dose
9. Issues CD prescription — documented in patient digital record with:
   - Patient name and date of birth
   - Product name (generic and brand), formulation and strength
   - Dose per administration
   - Frequency / injection interval
   - Route of administration
   - Prescriber name, GMC number, date, and signature
10. Orders follow-up investigations and books 3-month monitoring review
11. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Verification (Every Session — Injectable Route)

Before every injection, the Practitioner confirms:

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] Valid CD prescription on digital record — product, dose, and interval match
- [ ] Product in hand matches prescription (name, formulation, strength)
- [ ] Batch number and expiry date confirmed and recorded
- [ ] Injection due today — confirm injection interval has elapsed (not early)
- [ ] No new contraindications identified — patient screened verbally for new symptoms, new medications, or new diagnoses since last injection
- [ ] Haematocrit and PSA: confirm most recent results are within the monitoring schedule and no dose hold has been instructed by MD
- [ ] Signed Informed Consent on file (first session only: confirm consent document signed)

**If any item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Contact MD before administering.**

---

## 1.8 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol — Intramuscular Injection

> This section applies to Practitioner-administered injectable TRT (Nebido, Sustanon 250, Testosterone Enanthate). For topical gel, see Section 1.9.

### PRE-INJECTION

**P-1.** Verify patient identity and complete Stage 3 checklist. Document.

**P-2.** Confirm injection is due. Record in digital system: date, product, batch number, dose, injection site.

**P-3.** If Nebido (testosterone undecanoate 1,000 mg/4 mL): warm the vial to body temperature by holding in hands for 1–2 minutes. Confirm the solution is clear to pale yellow — do NOT use if cloudy, discoloured, or contains particulate matter.

**P-4.** Room preparation: patient positioned prone or lateral (for gluteal injection), or seated with arm relaxed (for deltoid — Sustanon/Enanthate ≤1 mL only). Maintain privacy throughout.

**P-5.** Confirm emergency equipment is accessible in clinic (adrenaline, anaphylaxis protocol).

---

### INJECTION DELIVERY

**Step 1.** Draw up the prescribed dose using a 21G drawing-up needle. Change to the injection needle (21G × 40 mm gluteal or 23G × 25 mm deltoid per MD protocol and patient habitus) before administration.

**Step 2.** Identify and mark the injection site:
- **Gluteal (preferred for Nebido and volumes >1 mL):** Ventrogluteal site (preferred) — palpate the greater trochanter and anterior superior iliac spine; inject into the gluteal muscle above and medial to the midpoint. Alternatively, dorsogluteal: upper outer quadrant of the buttock (avoid sciatic nerve).
- **Deltoid (for Sustanon/Enanthate 1 mL only, per MD plan):** Middle third of the deltoid, 2–3 finger-widths below the acromion.

**Step 3.** Cleanse the injection site with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe. Allow to fully air dry (minimum 30 seconds).

**Step 4.** Pinch or spread skin per site technique. Insert needle at 90° in one smooth, confident motion.

**Step 5.** Aspirate — pull back the plunger for 5–10 seconds. If blood appears — withdraw needle, apply pressure, dispose, re-draw and inject at a new site.

**Step 6.** Inject the testosterone preparation:
- **Nebido (4 mL):** Inject over a MINIMUM of 2 full minutes. Time it. Do not rush. Rapid injection elevates POME risk significantly.
- **Sustanon 250 / Testosterone Enanthate (1 mL):** Inject steadily over 10–15 seconds.

**Step 7.** Withdraw needle in the same angle as insertion. Apply sterile gauze with firm pressure for 30–60 seconds. Do NOT rub.

**Step 8.** Dispose of all sharps immediately. Do NOT recap needles.

**Step 9.** Apply small adhesive dressing if the patient requests it.

**Step 10.** Record: injection site (left/right, gluteal/deltoid), product, dose, batch number, time of injection. Rotate injection sites — document site used at each visit to enable rotation at the next.

---

### POST-INJECTION OBSERVATION (MANDATORY)

**Step 11.** Patient must remain in clinic under observation:
- **Nebido:** Minimum **30 minutes** — POME risk is highest immediately post-injection
- **Sustanon / Enanthate:** Minimum **15 minutes**

**Step 12.** During observation, monitor for:
- Cough, dyspnoea, chest tightness, or dizziness during or immediately post-injection → **POME — activate emergency protocol Section 1.10 immediately**
- Signs of anaphylaxis: urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension → **call 999 and activate emergency protocol**
- Vasovagal response: pallor, bradycardia, sweating → position supine, legs elevated, monitor
- Local haematoma or excessive bleeding at site → direct pressure; assess severity

**Step 13.** At end of observation: confirm patient is well. Remind of next injection date and any monitoring tests due. Book next appointment in system.

---

## 1.9 Topical Gel Initiation Protocol

> For patients prescribed topical testosterone gel by the MD. The Practitioner conducts a gel education and initiation session. The patient self-administers the gel at home daily.

**G-1.** Confirm CD prescription for the gel is on the digital record. Dispense product as prescribed.

**G-2.** Conduct structured education session covering:

| Topic | Key Points |
|---|---|
| **Application site** | Shoulders, upper arms, or abdomen (Testogel/Testim); inner thighs or abdomen (Tostran) — confirm per product IFU |
| **Application technique** | Squeeze or pump onto palm; spread thin, uniform layer; allow to dry fully (3–5 minutes) before dressing |
| **Transfer risk** | Gel must be dry and covered before skin contact with women of childbearing potential, children, or pets. Virilisation of women and children via gel transfer has been reported. Hand-washing after application mandatory. |
| **Missed dose** | If a dose is missed and remembered the same day — apply when remembered. If next day — skip the missed dose; do not double-dose. |
| **Storage** | Below 30°C; away from heat and naked flame (alcohol base — flammable) |
| **Timing** | Apply at the same time daily, ideally after morning shower |
| **What to avoid** | Do NOT apply to genitals. Do NOT apply to damaged or broken skin. |

**G-3.** Patient to demonstrate application technique back to the Practitioner before leaving (teach-back method). Document demonstrated competency.

**G-4.** Provide written gel instruction card. Record on digital system: product, dose, batch, date initiated.

**G-5.** Book 3-month monitoring review. Confirm bloods to be taken 2–4 hours post-gel application at the 3-month review (peak testosterone window for gel products).

---

## 1.10 Dose Adjustment Protocol

> Dose adjustments are exclusively the MD's decision. The Practitioner does not independently modify dose, interval, or product.

### Testosterone Level — Response at 3-Month Review

| Serum Testosterone Result | MD Action |
|---|---|
| **< 15 nmol/L** (below target) | Increase dose or reduce injection interval — per MD clinical decision. Document rationale. |
| **15–30 nmol/L** (within target) | Continue current prescription. No change. Document. |
| **> 30 nmol/L** (above target) | Reduce dose or increase injection interval. Recheck in 6–8 weeks. |
| **> 40 nmol/L** | Hold treatment until within range. MD to review product and dose. |

### Haematocrit — Response Protocol

| Haematocrit | MD Action |
|---|---|
| **< 50%** | Continue treatment. |
| **50–54%** | Continue with caution. Recheck at 8 weeks. Lifestyle advice (hydration, avoid smoking). MD review. |
| **≥ 54%** | **Hold TRT.** Recheck haematocrit in 4–6 weeks off treatment. Investigate for secondary polycythaemia. Reinitiate at reduced dose only if haematocrit returns to <50%. Consider referral to haematology. |

### PSA — Response Protocol

| PSA Change | MD Action |
|---|---|
| PSA remains < 3.0 ng/mL | Continue treatment. |
| PSA rise > 1.4 ng/mL from baseline over 12 months | **Hold TRT. Urology referral.** |
| PSA rise > 0.75 ng/mL in any 6-month period | **Hold TRT. Urology referral.** |
| PSA > 4.0 ng/mL (any time) | **Hold TRT immediately. Urology referral.** Do not reinitiate until urological clearance received. |

---

## 1.11 Structured Monitoring Schedule

> Monitoring is the responsibility of the MD who retains prescribing authority. The Practitioner takes blood and performs observations; the MD reviews all results before any prescription is renewed or adjusted.

### Monitoring Timetable

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Timing of Bloods (Injectable) | Timing of Bloods (Gel) | MD Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | See Section 1.5 (full panel) | Pre-treatment | Pre-treatment | Diagnostic assessment; initiation decision |
| **3 months** | Total testosterone, FBC + haematocrit, PSA, oestradiol, BP, symptoms reassessment | Mid-cycle (midpoint between injections) | 2–4 hours post-application | Dose adjustment if needed; confirm tolerability |
| **6 months** | Total testosterone, FBC + haematocrit, PSA, oestradiol, LFTs, lipids, BP, symptoms | Mid-cycle | 2–4 hours post-application | Full review; continuation decision |
| **12 months** | Full repeat of baseline panel (except diagnostic T samples — single sample sufficient once on treatment) | Mid-cycle | 2–4 hours post-application | Annual full review; continuation or cessation |
| **Annually thereafter** | As 12-month panel | Mid-cycle | 2–4 hours post-application | Annual full review |

### Validated Symptom Tools — Repeat at Every Monitoring Appointment

- ADAM Questionnaire
- AMS Scale
- IIEF-5 (if erectile dysfunction was a presenting complaint)
- Patient-reported satisfaction: overall, sexual function, energy, mood, body composition

---

## 1.12 Treatment Cessation Protocol

> Cessation decisions are the MD's sole clinical decision. The Practitioner does not initiate cessation independently unless there is an immediate safety concern (e.g., absolute contraindication identified on the day — in which case the Practitioner withholds the injection and contacts the MD immediately).

### Planned Cessation (MD-Directed)

**Indications for cessation:**
- PSA rise meeting urology referral threshold
- Haematocrit ≥54% failing to respond to dose reduction
- Patient wishes to discontinue
- New diagnosis of prostate carcinoma or male breast cancer (immediate cessation)
- Clinical review determines benefits no longer outweigh risks
- Patient desiring fertility — transition to fertility management (HCG ± FSH co-therapy under endocrine/urology guidance)

**Cessation process:**
1. MD conducts cessation review consultation
2. Patient counselled on symptom recurrence (hypogonadism symptoms will return as endogenous production resumes — typically 2–6 months post-cessation for shorter-acting products; longer for Nebido)
3. Final monitoring bloods at time of last injection / gel supply
4. Follow-up testosterone check 8–12 weeks post-cessation to assess HPG axis recovery
5. Document in digital record and close active treatment episode

---

## 1.13 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

> Activates for Grade 3+ adverse events. POME and anaphylaxis require immediate 999 call simultaneously.

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Expected: injection site soreness, mild erythema, temporary mood change, minor swelling | Document in app. Advise patient. No escalation. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: haematoma at injection site, significantly elevated haematocrit (requiring protocol review), mood disturbance requiring management | Document in app. Telephone MD. Record guidance. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: POME (pulmonary oil microembolism — respiratory symptoms post-injection), anaphylaxis, stroke/TIA, DVT/PE, haematocrit ≥54% with symptoms, new suspected prostate malignancy | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION + CALL 999** |

### Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) — Specific Protocol

**Signs during or within 30 minutes of Nebido injection:** cough, dyspnoea, chest pain, dizziness, syncope, or neurological symptoms.

**Immediate action:**
1. STOP the injection immediately if still in progress.
2. Position patient supine. Call 999. State: "patient has received intramuscular testosterone undecanoate — suspected pulmonary oil microembolism."
3. Administer oxygen if available. ABCDE assessment.
4. Do NOT leave the patient unattended.
5. Activate emergency escalation (Step E-2 below) simultaneously.

### Full Escalation Protocol — All Grade 3 Events

**Step E-1:** Manage patient emergency (POME, anaphylaxis, cardiovascular event) as above. Call 999 for life-threatening emergencies FIRST.

**Step E-2: Digital Logging — Trigger Automated Escalation**

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)
**Product prescribed:** _____________________________ **Route:** _____________________________
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete and accurate information about TRT before agreeing to start. You should take the time to read this carefully. You may ask questions. You may change your mind and stop treatment at any time.

---

## 3.2 What TRT Is

TRT replaces testosterone that your body is not producing in sufficient quantities. Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone. It regulates libido, energy, mood, muscle mass, bone density, fat distribution, and cognitive function. When testosterone is clinically low — confirmed by blood tests and matching symptoms — replacing it can significantly improve quality of life.

This is an ongoing programme, not a one-off treatment. If effective, you will likely remain on TRT long-term. Your response will be monitored at structured intervals and your prescription reviewed and renewed by the Manchester Medical Director at each monitoring point.

---

## 3.3 Regulatory Status

Testosterone is a **Schedule 4 Part II Controlled Drug** and a **Prescription-Only Medicine** under UK law. It has been prescribed for you specifically by the Menhancements Manchester Medical Director following a full clinical assessment. Your prescription is for a specific product, dose, and frequency. You must not share it, transfer it, or use it in any way other than as prescribed.

---

## 3.4 Fertility Impact — Read This Section Carefully

**TRT will significantly reduce or eliminate your ability to produce sperm** in the majority of men. This is because TRT works by replacing testosterone from outside the body, which signals the brain to stop producing the hormones (LH and FSH) that stimulate the testes to make both testosterone and sperm. This effect is present at all standard therapeutic doses.

- **For most men on TRT, sperm count will fall to very low or zero within 3–6 months**
- This effect is typically reversible after stopping TRT — sperm production usually recovers over 6–18 months — but recovery is not guaranteed
- If you may wish to father children in the future, **sperm banking before starting TRT** is strongly recommended
- **HCG co-therapy** (a separate prescription to stimulate testicular function alongside TRT) can preserve sperm production for some men — your MD can discuss this option

You have been counselled on this risk. Your decision regarding sperm banking and/or HCG co-therapy has been documented:

Fertility discussion outcome: ☐ Patient does not desire future fertility — counselled and documented
☐ Patient to undergo sperm banking before initiation — referred: _______
☐ Patient to receive HCG co-therapy — MD to prescribe: ☐ Yes ☐ Under review
☐ Patient uncertain — further discussion required before prescription issued

---

## 3.5 Expected Benefits (Not Guaranteed)

If you respond to TRT, you may experience:
- Increased libido and sexual drive
- Improved erectile function (in combination with appropriate treatment of any vascular component)
- Increased energy and reduced fatigue
- Improved mood, motivation, and mental clarity
- Increased lean muscle mass; reduction in body fat
- Improved bone mineral density over the longer term
- Improvement in AMS/ADAM symptom scores

**Results are individual.** Not all patients respond equally. Some men see dramatic improvement; others see limited benefit. The degree of improvement generally correlates with how deficient testosterone was at baseline and the severity of symptoms. Results become apparent over weeks to months — not days.

---

## 3.6 Risks and Potential Side Effects

**Common:**
- Acne — particularly in first 3–6 months; usually settles
- Increased oiliness of skin
- Testicular atrophy (reduction in testicular size and firmness) — a direct consequence of HPG axis suppression; expected on TRT
- Fluid retention — mild ankle swelling in some patients
- Injection site discomfort, bruising, or temporary soreness (injectable route)
- Mood fluctuation — particularly at start or with dose adjustments
- Elevated haematocrit / haemoglobin — requires monitoring and dose management

**Uncommon:**
- Elevated oestradiol (oestrogen) — from aromatisation of testosterone; can cause nipple sensitivity, water retention, or mood changes; managed with dose adjustment or, if MD prescribes, an aromatase inhibitor
- Skin transfer of gel to others (gel route) — risk of virilisation of female partners or children if gel is not fully absorbed before contact
- Sleep apnoea — TRT can exacerbate or unmask OSA
- Polycythaemia — high red cell count elevating clot risk; monitored and managed by dose adjustment or treatment pause

**Rare but serious:**
- **Pulmonary oil microembolism (POME)** — specific to oily injectable testosterone (particularly Nebido); rare; presents with cough, breathlessness, or dizziness during or shortly after injection. This is a medical emergency. Protocol is in place at every clinic. You will be observed for 30 minutes post-injection. If symptoms occur after you leave clinic, call 999.
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism — risk elevated by polycythaemia; regular haematocrit monitoring is a direct safeguard
- Prostate effects — TRT does not cause prostate cancer but may stimulate growth of pre-existing prostate cancer; regular PSA monitoring is a direct safeguard
- Cardiovascular events — the relationship between TRT and cardiovascular risk is complex; current evidence suggests TRT in men with true hypogonadism has a neutral to beneficial cardiovascular effect, but individual risk must be assessed

**Long-term:**
- The very long-term effects of TRT over decades are well-documented for most outcomes, but ongoing monitoring remains essential

---

## 3.7 Monitoring Commitment

Starting TRT requires a commitment to structured monitoring. You agree to attend:
- **3-month review** — blood tests and symptom assessment
- **6-month review** — blood tests and full clinical review
- **Annual review** — comprehensive reassessment, all baseline parameters repeated

If you do not attend monitoring appointments, your prescription cannot be renewed. This is a patient safety requirement, not a commercial one.

## 4.1 What to Expect — Early Weeks and Months

TRT does not produce instant results. The hormone needs time to reach stable therapeutic levels in your blood, and your tissues need time to respond.

**Weeks 1–4:** You may notice improved energy and libido beginning. Injection site may be sore for 1–3 days.

**Weeks 4–8:** Mood and energy gains typically become more consistent. Libido often improves noticeably.

**Months 2–4:** Significant improvements in energy, motivation, and sexual function in responders. Some men notice changes in body composition beginning. Acne may appear at this stage — usually settles.

**Months 4–6 and beyond:** Maximum benefit often takes 3–6 months or longer. Muscle mass changes, fat redistribution, and bone density improvements develop over months to years of sustained treatment.

**If you feel no improvement by 6 months:** Report this at your 6-month review. Your MD will reassess whether TRT is working for you, or whether there are other factors to address.

---

## 4.2 Your Monitoring Schedule — Non-Negotiable

| Review | When | What It Involves |
|---|---|---|
| **3-month review** | 3 months after first treatment | Blood tests: testosterone, FBC, PSA, oestradiol. BP check. Symptom questionnaires. MD reviews and adjusts prescription if needed. |
| **6-month review** | 6 months after first treatment | Blood tests: full panel. MD full clinical review. Dose confirmed or adjusted. |
| **Annual review** | Every 12 months | Full baseline panel repeated. MD assessment. Prescription renewed only after review. |

**Your prescription cannot be renewed without a completed monitoring review. Missing your monitoring appointment means treatment pauses until review is completed.**

---

## 4.3 Injections — What to Expect at Each Visit

- **Sustanon / Enanthate:** You will attend every 2–4 weeks (as prescribed). Each visit takes approximately 20–30 minutes including observation.
- **Nebido:** You will attend at Week 0, Week 6 (loading dose), then every 10–14 weeks. Each Nebido visit takes approximately 40 minutes including mandatory 30-minute post-injection observation.

Injection site soreness for 1–3 days is expected and normal. Sites are rotated at each visit to minimise tissue accumulation.

---

## 4.4 Topical Gel — Daily Discipline (Gel Route Only)

- Apply at the same time every day. Do not skip doses.
- Apply to clean, dry skin on the shoulders, upper arms, or abdomen (per your product instructions).
- Allow to dry completely before dressing — minimum 5 minutes.
- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after every application.
- **Cover the application area with clothing before skin contact with others** — particularly women and children. Gel transfer can cause virilisation.
- Store gel away from heat and naked flame (alcohol base — flammable).

---

## 4.5 What You Must Report to the Clinic

**Report at your next appointment (non-urgent):**
- Acne or significant skin changes
- Mood changes — irritability, anxiety, or low mood
- Ankle swelling
- Nipple sensitivity or breast enlargement
- Reduced or absent testicular size (expected, but report for documentation)
- Reduced frequency or quality of erections

**Call the clinic same day (urgent but not emergency):**
- Significant injection site swelling, redness, or warmth beyond 48 hours (possible infection)
- Any new urinary symptoms (increased frequency, hesitancy, poor stream) — possible prostate change requiring PSA check
- New or worsening snoring or sleep disruption (possible OSA onset or worsening)

---

## 4.6 Emergency Red Flags — Call 999 Immediately

🔴 **Cough, breathlessness, chest pain, or dizziness during or within 30 minutes of an injection** — possible pulmonary oil microembolism (POME). Call 999. Tell them you have received an intramuscular testosterone injection.

🔴 **Sudden leg pain, swelling, or redness** combined with shortness of breath — possible DVT and pulmonary embolism. Call 999.

🔴 **Chest pain, left arm pain, or sudden onset of neurological symptoms** (face drooping, arm weakness, slurred speech) — possible cardiac event or stroke. Call 999 immediately.

🔴 **Rash, throat swelling, difficulty breathing, or collapse** — anaphylaxis. Call 999.

🔴 **Sudden severe pain, marked swelling, or rapid discolouration at injection site** — possible haematoma or infection requiring urgent assessment. Go to A&E.
