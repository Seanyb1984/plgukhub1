# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Penile Dermal Filler — Hyaluronic Acid Shaft Augmentation
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-003 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler injection to the penile shaft at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. The procedure augments penile shaft volume through subcutaneous and subdermal HA filler placement, with outcome assessment focusing on patient-reported satisfaction, symmetry, and soft-tissue homogeneity.

**This is a high-risk anatomical site.** The penile shaft contains the dorsal neurovascular bundle (dorsal artery, deep dorsal vein, dorsal nerves), bilateral cavernosal arteries, and the corpus spongiosum. Vascular occlusion, though rare, is a limb-equivalent emergency capable of causing penile ischaemia and necrosis if not reversed within a critical time window. This pathway is non-negotiable in its safety architecture.

**Prescribing summary:** Three Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) are required for this procedure:
1. **EMLA Cream** (lidocaine 2.5% / prilocaine 2.5%) — topical anaesthetic
2. **Injectable Lidocaine** (1% or 2%) — for penile dorsal nerve block
3. **Hyaluronidase** — emergency HA filler reversal agent

All three are prescribed exclusively by the **Manchester Medical Director (MD)**. Critically, hyaluronidase must be prescribed, present, and accessible in the treatment room **before any filler is opened**. No exceptions. The MD prescribes; the Practitioner delivers.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — HYALURONIDASE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
> Hyaluronidase (a Prescription-Only Medicine) MUST be physically present in the treatment room before the first syringe of filler is opened. If hyaluronidase is not available — **treatment does not proceed.** Contact MD immediately. This is not a preference; it is a patient safety absolute.

> **NOTICE 2 — HIGH-RISK ANATOMICAL ZONE**
> The penile shaft is a high-risk injection site due to its neurovascular anatomy. Only Practitioners with documented competency in high-risk HA filler and a working knowledge of penile vascular anatomy may perform this procedure. Competency must be on file before the first treatment session.

> **NOTICE 3 — POM PRESCRIPTIONS ARE MANDATORY**
> Three separate POM prescriptions must be present on the patient's digital record before any preparation begins: EMLA cream, injectable lidocaine, and hyaluronidase. The Manchester MD issues all three. No POM prescriptions = no treatment.

# PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

---

## 1.1 Treatment Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment Name** | Penile Shaft HA Filler — Hyaluronic Acid Augmentation |
| **Active Agent** | Hyaluronic Acid (HA) dermal filler — high G' (cohesive, firm), cross-linked. Lidocaine-containing product preferred for intra-procedure analgesia. Specific product per MD clinical preference and treatment plan. |
| **Regulatory Classification** | The HA filler is a UKCA/CE-marked medical device (not a POM). The anaesthetic agents (EMLA, injectable lidocaine) and reversal agent (hyaluronidase) ARE POMs — prescribed by Manchester MD. |
| **Off-Label Status** | Penile shaft HA filler injection is an off-label use. This must be disclosed explicitly to the patient. |
| **Target Tissue** | Subdermal / subcutaneous plane of the penile shaft — immediately deep to Buck's fascia on dorsal/lateral surfaces, above the tunica albuginea ventrally. The corpus cavernosum and spongiosum are NOT injection targets. |
| **Volume Range** | Typically 10–25 mL total HA per session (volume per MD treatment plan). Large-volume sessions may be staged across 2 visits. |
| **Injection Technique** | Retrograde linear threading or blunt-cannula fanning in the subcutaneous plane. Sharp needle injection for precise placement only. Aspiration mandatory at all new needle positions. |
| **Onset of Result** | Immediate volumisation; final result assessment at 4 weeks (post-swelling resolution) |
| **Duration of Effect** | 12–24 months (product and patient-dependent; HA in high-mobility tissue may metabolise faster than facial sites) |
| **Repeat Frequency** | Minimum 6 months between full top-up sessions; MD review before any additional volume |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

---

## 1.2 Indications

**Primary Indications:**
- Patient-reported concern regarding penile shaft volume, symmetry, or proportion
- Post-weight-loss change in penile shaft soft-tissue appearance
- Psychological impact of penile appearance concern on quality of life or sexual confidence (documented)
- Post-filler review — additional volume or symmetry correction following a prior treatment

**Relative / Supported Indications:**
- Documented penile dysmorphic concern in the absence of objective abnormality — management discussion with MD mandatory; psychological support pathway to be offered and documented before proceeding

**Not an Indication for This Procedure:**
- Treatment of erectile dysfunction (refer to MEN-CP-001)
- Peyronie's disease correction (HA filler is not a treatment for fibrotic plaque — refer to LFSWT pathway MEN-CP-001 or urology)

---

## 1.3 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Hyaluronidase unavailable in treatment room | Safety absolute — no reversal agent = no treatment |
| Known allergy to hyaluronic acid or any HA filler component (including avian-derived cross-linkers where applicable) | Anaphylaxis risk; severe inflammatory granuloma risk |
| Known allergy to lidocaine or prilocaine (EMLA components) | Alternative anaesthetic plan must be established by MD before any treatment — no alternative plan = no treatment |
| Active infection, cellulitis, abscess, open wound, or acute dermatological condition at the injection site | Contraindicated per filler clinical guidance; high risk of seeding deep infection |
| Active herpes simplex virus (HSV) outbreak affecting genital region | Filler injection can trigger severe HSV dissemination |
| Coagulopathy or active anticoagulant therapy without medical clearance | High bleeding and haematoma risk in highly vascular anatomical zone |
| Penile implant (malleable or inflatable prosthesis) | High risk of implant damage, contamination, or disruption of filler plane |
| History of penile vascular compromise or documented vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (severe) | Pre-existing circulatory compromise dramatically elevates ischaemia risk |
| Active Peyronie's disease with significant curvature (>30°) | Filler injection into fibrotic/deformed penile tissue is unpredictable and may worsen deformity |
| Recent penile surgery or circumcision (<6 months) | Altered tissue planes; healing tissue; poor filler distribution |
| Patient under 18 years | Not appropriate; not lawful |
| Patient lacking capacity to consent | Legally prohibited |
| No valid MD prescriptions for EMLA, lidocaine, and hyaluronidase on the patient digital record | Clinical governance absolute stop |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy | MD to review bleeding risk; advise cessation or document informed risk of bruising and haematoma |
| Significant scrotal or inguinal lymphoedema | MD review; altered tissue drainage may affect filler distribution and longevity |
| Diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled, HbA1c >75 mmol/mol) | Elevated infection risk; impaired healing; MD review |
| Immunosuppressant therapy | Elevated infection risk; MD review; enhanced post-procedure monitoring |
| History of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation | Risk of abnormal fibrotic response; MD assessment |
| Unrealistic patient expectations (documented) | MD / Practitioner expectation alignment consultation required before proceeding |
| BMI >35 | Altered tissue planes and filler distribution; MD to review product choice and volume |
| Prior HA filler to the penile shaft (at Menhancements or elsewhere) | Volume of existing filler must be assessed; risk of overcorrection and compartment pressure; MD review mandatory |
| History of penile inflammatory or granulomatous reaction to prior filler | MD assessment; may indicate hypersensitivity — previous product must be identified |
| Documented penile dysmorphic disorder without psychology input | Refer to psychological support; proceed only after MD documents patient has appropriate insight and realistic expectations |

---

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 30–45 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Records presenting concern, expectation, and prior filler history (at this clinic and elsewhere)
2. Completes full medical history and medication review
3. Performs contraindication screen in full (Section 1.3)
4. Conducts clinical examination: penile shaft skin quality, tissue turgor, existing volume, symmetry, any palpable abnormality, evidence of prior filler product
5. Records baseline clinical photographs: flaccid state, standardised angles (frontal, lateral left, lateral right, inferior) — stored in digital record. Photography is mandatory; no photography = no treatment
6. Identifies and documents patient's anatomical areas of concern
7. **Does NOT prescribe any POM**
8. **Does NOT open, prepare, or prime any filler product or POM**
9. Completes MD Referral Trigger Checklist (Part 2, Section D) and transmits to Manchester MD

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation (standard for Leeds/Wilmslow/Wigan) OR in-person (Manchester)
**Timing:** Must be completed in full before any treatment session

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner assessment, photographs, and referral documentation
2. Conducts independent clinical assessment with the patient — treatment goals, expectations, history
3. Reviews all contraindications; confirms clinical suitability
4. Confirms Practitioner competency record is on file for high-risk HA filler in this anatomical zone
5. Discusses and documents the off-label nature of this procedure with the patient
6. Selects HA filler product, total volume per session, and documents the injection plan (zones, volumes per zone, cannula vs. needle approach)
7. Issues written prescriptions for all three POMs:
   - EMLA cream (quantity, application instructions)
   - Injectable lidocaine (concentration, volume, technique)
   - Hyaluronidase (standing emergency prescription — dose protocol for vascular occlusion: typically 1,500 IU initial dose, repeated every 60 minutes as required)
8. Documents full prescribing rationale, product selected, and volume plan in patient digital record
9. Signs and dates all prescriptions with GMC number
10. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

> **MD HYALURONIDASE PRESCRIPTION FORMAT:**
> Must specify: product name, total vials to be held in room during treatment, reconstitution protocol, dose for emergency use, dose for elective reversal, and MD emergency contact for guidance during a vascular occlusion event.

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Prescription Verification (Mandatory Checklist)

Before any preparation begins, the Practitioner completes and records this checklist:

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (full name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] MD prescription for EMLA cream present, dated, signed
- [ ] MD prescription for injectable lidocaine present, dated, signed
- [ ] MD prescription for hyaluronidase present, dated, signed
- [ ] Hyaluronidase physically in treatment room — vials checked, expiry confirmed
- [ ] Filler product in room — batch number and expiry confirmed; matches MD treatment plan
- [ ] Signed Informed Consent on file
- [ ] Baseline photographs on file in digital record
- [ ] Vascular occlusion protocol card accessible in room
- [ ] Emergency adrenaline confirmed accessible in clinic
- [ ] No new contraindications identified today (verbal patient confirmation)

**If ANY item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Do not proceed. Contact MD.**

Checklist completion recorded in digital patient record with Practitioner initials and timestamp.

---

### STAGE 4 — Treatment Delivery

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner, following all Stage 1–3 requirements
**Protocol:** See Section 1.6

---

## 1.6 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT (All Mandatory)

**P-1.** Confirm patient identity against digital record. Obtain verbal confirmation of ongoing consent.

**P-2.** Complete the Stage 3 prescription and pre-treatment verification checklist. Document completion.

**P-3.** Review patient's baseline photographs and MD injection plan. Confirm understanding of target zones and volumes before opening any product.

**P-4.** Room preparation: treatment couch with disposable cover, directional lighting confirmed, all equipment on sterile field, sharps and clinical waste positioned, vascular occlusion protocol card visible.

**P-5.** Pre-treatment photographs: take today's standardised set to match baseline. Record in digital system.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA APPLICATION

**Step 1.** Confirm EMLA prescription on file. Ask patient to undress from the waist down. Position supine. Ensure privacy throughout session.

**Step 2.** Apply EMLA cream generously to the full penile shaft — dorsal, lateral, and ventral surfaces. Cover with occlusive dressing (Tegaderm or cling film). Record application time.

**Step 3.** Wait minimum **60 minutes.** Patient may remain covered during this period.

**Step 4.** Remove EMLA. Confirm anaesthesia via light touch and gentle pin-prick test. If inadequate — wait further 15 minutes and retest. **Do not proceed to nerve block or filler injection if surface anaesthesia is inadequate.**

---

### PHASE 2 — PENILE DORSAL NERVE BLOCK

> The dorsal nerve block provides deep anaesthesia of the penile shaft and is essential for patient comfort during filler injection. It is performed after EMLA has taken effect.

**Step 5.** Confirm injectable lidocaine prescription on file and draw up per MD-prescribed volume (typically lidocaine 1% or 2%, total 3–6 mL, divided bilaterally).

**Step 6.** Cleanse the injection sites at the base of the penis (10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions at the penile base / pubic symphysis junction) with chlorhexidine. Allow to fully dry.

**Step 7.** Using a 30G needle, inject lidocaine slowly at each dorsal base position to infiltrate the dorsal nerve bilaterally. Aspirate before each injection — if blood returns, reposition before injecting.

**Step 8.** Wait 5–10 minutes for full nerve block effect. Test sensation across the penile shaft dorsum and lateral surfaces before proceeding. **Do not inject filler until effective block is confirmed.**

---

### PHASE 3 — SKIN PREPARATION & STERILE FIELD

**Step 9.** Cleanse the entire penile shaft circumferentially with chlorhexidine 2% in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Begin at the glans-shaft junction and work proximally. Allow to fully air dry.

**Step 10.** Apply fenestrated sterile drape around the penile shaft. Maintain aseptic non-touch technique for the remainder of the procedure.

**Step 11.** Confirm hyaluronidase is on the sterile field (reconstituted or ready to reconstitute) within immediate reach.

---

### PHASE 4 — FILLER PREPARATION & CANNULA ENTRY

**Step 12.** Record filler product batch number and expiry in digital record before opening. Inspect packaging integrity.

**Step 13.** Prime cannula with filler per manufacturer instructions. Do not trap air in the cannula.

**Step 14.** Create cannula entry ports using a sharp entry needle (21G or 23G) at the planned access points — typically at the penoscrotal junction (1–2 entry points) and/or mid-shaft lateral positions, per MD injection plan. One entry point per zone where possible to minimise punctures.

---

### PHASE 5 — FILLER INJECTION

> Aspirate before injecting at every new cannula position. If blood flashback is seen — reposition. Never inject against resistance.

**Step 15.** Insert blunt-tip cannula through entry port. Advance in the subcutaneous / subdermal plane — immediately deep to the skin, superficial to Buck's fascia on dorsal and lateral surfaces.

> **Anatomical avoidance:** The dorsal neurovascular bundle runs in the midline dorsum of the shaft between Buck's fascia and the tunica albuginea. **Cannula placement should remain superficial to Buck's fascia.** Avoid direct midline dorsal injection — approach from a lateral angle to distribute product bilaterally while avoiding the neurovascular bundle.

**Step 16.** Aspirate by withdrawing the plunger of the filler syringe. Confirm no blood. Inject using slow, even retrograde linear threading — deposit filler as the cannula is withdrawn. Use consistent pressure. Stop immediately if resistance is felt.

**Step 17.** Work through all zones per MD treatment plan (dorsal, bilateral lateral, ventral — in that order). Target even, homogeneous distribution. Record volume deposited per zone in digital record.

**Step 18.** After each zone, pause and assess distribution by gentle visual inspection (do not palpate aggressively). If focal accumulation or blanching is noted — **STOP. See vascular occlusion protocol in Section 1.7.**

**Step 19.** After all filler delivered, perform careful, low-pressure moulding of filler into an even distribution using flat-hand gentle strokes from distal to proximal. Do NOT apply firm pressure.

**Step 20.** Remove cannula. Apply gentle gauze pressure to all entry points until haemostasis is confirmed.

**Step 21.** Dispose of all sharps and filler product waste immediately and appropriately.

---

### POST-TREATMENT CHECKS (Mandatory Before Discharge)

**Step 22.** Assess penile shaft colour, capillary refill, and temperature. The shaft should be uniformly pink and warm. Blanching, mottling, dark discolouration, or cold tissue are vascular emergency signs — activate Section 1.7 immediately.

**Step 23.** Observe patient in clinic for minimum **30 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Vascular compromise (blanching, cyanosis, tissue mottling — any sign = emergency; see Section 1.7)
- Anaphylaxis or allergic reaction (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension)
- Vasovagal episode
- Haematoma formation
- Significant pain beyond expected mild post-procedural discomfort

**Step 24.** Record in digital app: product, batch, total volume per zone, cannula used, patient response, any adverse events.

**Step 25.** Post-treatment photographs: standardised set immediately post-procedure (with visible swelling documented as such). Record in digital system.

**Step 26.** Book 4-week review (outcome assessment + clinical photography). Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up contact via CRM.

**Step 27.** Provide patient with printed Aftercare Protocol (Part 4). Verbally review vascular occlusion emergency red flags before patient leaves.

---

## 1.7 Vascular Occlusion Emergency Protocol

> **Vascular occlusion of the penile vasculature is a time-critical emergency. Irreversible tissue ischaemia can develop within 4–6 hours. The hyaluronidase protocol below must be initiated at the FIRST sign of vascular compromise — do not wait for complete occlusion to declare itself.**

### Signs of Vascular Compromise — Act Immediately

| Sign | Description |
|---|---|
| **Blanching** | Area becomes white or pale immediately during or after injection |
| **Mottling / livedo** | Irregular purple-red network pattern on skin surface |
| **Cyanosis** | Blue or grey discolouration of tissue |
| **Loss of capillary refill** | Skin does not pink up within 2 seconds after blanch test |
| **Disproportionate pain** | Pain out of keeping with expected post-injection discomfort |
| **Cold tissue** | Localised or general shaft becomes cold to touch |
| **Tissue darkening** | Late sign — black or dark brown discolouration (approaching necrosis) |

### Immediate Hyaluronidase Reversal Protocol

**V-1.** STOP ALL FILLER INJECTION immediately.

**V-2.** Call the Manchester MD emergency line immediately for live guidance. Do not manage this in isolation.

**V-3.** Reconstitute hyaluronidase per MD prescription and manufacturer IFU (typically: Hyalase 1,500 IU reconstituted in 1 mL 0.9% saline = 1,500 IU/mL).

**V-4.** Inject hyaluronidase liberally throughout the affected zone and surrounding tissue — fan it widely through and around the area of concern. Typical initial dose: **1,500 IU** (1 mL of reconstituted solution per affected region). Do not be conservative — under-dosing is a greater risk than over-dosing.

**V-5.** Massage the area gently to distribute hyaluronidase through the tissue.

**V-6.** Reassess tissue colour and capillary refill every 5–10 minutes. If no improvement within 60 minutes — repeat hyaluronidase dose (1,500 IU) and call 999.

**V-7.** If any signs of progressing ischaemia, worsening colour change, or patient distress — **call 999 immediately.** Do not delay emergency services while waiting for further clinical improvement.

**V-8.** Activate the full emergency escalation protocol (Section 1.8) simultaneously.

**V-9.** Do not discharge the patient until tissue perfusion is confirmed normal and MD has given clearance.

## 1.8 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

> Activates for ALL Grade 3+ adverse events. Vascular occlusion, anaphylaxis, and severe haematoma trigger immediate activation alongside clinical management.

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Expected: bruising, mild swelling, minor discomfort | Document in app. Monitor. Advise per aftercare. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: significant haematoma, prolonged pain >4 hours, asymmetric swelling | Document in app. Telephone MD directly. Record guidance. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: vascular occlusion signs, anaphylaxis, priapism, severe deep haematoma, tissue discolouration | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION PROTOCOL — simultaneously with clinical management** |

### Full Escalation Protocol — Severe Adverse Event

**Step E-1: Patient Safety First**
- **Vascular occlusion:** Initiate hyaluronidase protocol (Section 1.7) immediately. Call MD emergency line. Call 999 if no improvement at 60 minutes or if deteriorating at any point.

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Penile Shaft HA Filler — Hyaluronic Acid Augmentation
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete, honest, and clinically accurate information about the procedure you are considering. You may take as much time as needed. You may ask questions at any point. You may withdraw consent at any time before or during treatment without negative consequences to your ongoing care.

---

## 3.2 What the Treatment Involves

A hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler — a gel-like substance made of a naturally occurring sugar found in the body — is injected into the soft tissue of the penile shaft in multiple areas using a fine, blunt-tipped cannula or needle. The filler occupies space within the tissue, adding volume and improving the uniformity of the shaft profile.

Before injection:
- A topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA, a prescription medicine prescribed by our Manchester Medical Director) is applied to the shaft skin for 60 minutes.
- A penile nerve block (an injection of local anaesthetic, also a prescription medicine prescribed by our Manchester Medical Director) is administered at the penile base to provide deep anaesthesia during the procedure.

The injection itself takes approximately 20–40 minutes. Post-procedure, you will remain observed in clinic for at least 30 minutes before discharge.

---

## 3.3 Prescription-Only Medicines Used

Three prescription-only medicines are used as part of this treatment:
1. **EMLA Cream** — topical anaesthetic applied to the skin before treatment
2. **Injectable Lidocaine** — anaesthetic for the nerve block
3. **Hyaluronidase** — an enzyme that dissolves HA filler; held in the room at all times during treatment in case of an emergency

All three have been prescribed specifically for you by the Menhancements Manchester Medical Director following a clinical assessment. The Medical Director does not perform the injection; your treating Practitioner does.

---

## 3.4 Off-Label Use Disclosure

The injection of hyaluronic acid filler into the penile shaft is an **off-label use** of this medical device. Off-label procedures are lawful in the UK when performed by appropriately trained clinicians who have satisfied themselves of the clinical rationale. The Manchester Medical Director has reviewed the available evidence and considers this treatment appropriate in your case. You have the right to request further information about the evidence base.

---

## 3.5 Realistic Outcomes

**Results are not guaranteed.** Possible outcomes include:
- Immediate increase in penile shaft volume — visible and palpable
- Final assessment at 4 weeks post-procedure (swelling resolves fully by this point)
- Duration of effect: typically 12–24 months (varies by individual; high-mobility tissue metabolises HA faster than facial sites)
- Repeat treatment required to maintain results
- Some asymmetry of distribution is possible and may require correction at the 4-week review
- Non-response (filler metabolises rapidly) occurs in some patients

No specific measurement outcome has been promised or guaranteed. Any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate.

---

## 3.6 Risks and Potential Complications

**Common (expected and usually temporary):**
- Swelling — often significant in the first 24–72 hours; resolves by 1–2 weeks
- Bruising at injection entry points and along the shaft — resolves within 7–14 days
- Tenderness and firmness — improves over 2–4 weeks as filler integrates
- Temporary irregular texture or lumpiness — usually resolves; may require massage or correction

**Uncommon:**
- Significant haematoma (blood collection) — may require medical drainage
- Asymmetry or uneven distribution — may be corrected with additional filler or hyaluronidase at 4-week review
- Palpable or visible nodule formation — may be treated with hyaluronidase
- Delayed swelling or inflammatory reaction to the filler product

**Rare but serious:**
- **Vascular occlusion** — the most serious potential complication. If filler enters or compresses a blood vessel supplying the penile tissue, it can restrict blood flow, causing tissue ischaemia and, if untreated, permanent tissue damage or necrosis. We carry hyaluronidase in the treatment room at all times for immediate reversal. The risk is reduced by using blunt cannulas and aspiration technique but cannot be eliminated entirely. You must know the warning signs and act immediately (see aftercare red flags).
- Infection at injection sites — may require antibiotic treatment
- Allergic or anaphylactic reaction to filler or anaesthetic agents — medical emergency (emergency medication is held in the clinic)
- Granuloma formation — a chronic inflammatory nodule that may require medical treatment or surgical excision
- Changes to penile sensation — usually temporary; rarely persistent

**Long-term / unknown risks:**
The long-term behaviour of HA filler in penile tissue over many years and after multiple treatment cycles is not fully established. You accept this uncertainty.

**Filler dissolution:**
If you wish to have the filler removed, or if a complication requires it, hyaluronidase can be injected to dissolve the HA filler. This is not immediate — full resolution may take days to weeks and may require multiple sessions. Complete removal cannot be guaranteed.

---

## 3.7 Alternatives

- No treatment
- Psychological support for appearance concern (referral available through Menhancements)
- LFSWT / PRP for sexual function (separate pathway — MEN-CP-001)
- Surgical augmentation (not offered at Menhancements; referral can be discussed with MD)

# PART 4: AFTERCARE PROTOCOL

---

**Patient Copy — Keep This Document**

**Treatment received:** Penile Shaft HA Filler
**Date of treatment:** _____________
**Clinic:** _____________
**Your treating Practitioner:** _____________
**4-week review appointment:** _____________

---

## 4.1 What to Expect

**First 24–48 hours:**
- Significant swelling of the penile shaft — this is expected and is not the final result. Do not judge the outcome until 4 weeks post-treatment.
- Bruising at cannula entry points and along the shaft — peaks at 48–72 hours; resolves within 7–14 days
- Firmness — the shaft will feel harder than normal initially; this softens as the filler integrates over 2–4 weeks
- Slight numbness or altered sensation — residual from the nerve block; fully resolves within 4–6 hours of the block wearing off

**First 2 weeks:**
- Gradual softening of filler texture
- Bruising fades progressively

**At 4 weeks:**
- Swelling fully resolved — this is when the final result can be assessed
- Your 4-week review appointment is when clinical photographs will be taken and compared to your baseline

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — Follow Exactly

**Sexual activity:**
- **No sexual activity of any kind for 7 days.** This includes masturbation and penetrative sex.
- After 7 days: gentle activity is acceptable. Avoid vigorous or prolonged friction for a full 4 weeks.

**Massage:**
- Gentle daily moulding massage (as demonstrated by your Practitioner) from Day 3 onwards to maintain even filler distribution. Use a light, flat-hand rolling motion from distal to proximal. Do NOT press hard or aggressively manipulate.

**Position:**
- Maintain an upright or semi-reclined position for the first 4 hours post-treatment.
- Avoid prolonged pressure on the shaft (e.g., tight underwear) for 48 hours.

**Clothing:**
- Wear loose-fitting, non-constrictive underwear for the first 5 days. Avoid tight-fitting garments that apply sustained lateral or compressive pressure to the shaft.

**Physical activity:**
- Avoid vigorous exercise, cycling, or any activity creating direct friction or compression of the treated area for **7 days.**
- Light walking is acceptable from the next day.

**Hygiene:**
- Normal showering is fine after 24 hours using gentle soap.
- No swimming, hot tubs, or saunas for **5 days.**

**Temperature:**
- Avoid heat exposure (saunas, hot baths, direct heat) for **48 hours** — heat accelerates initial filler migration risk.
- Cold packs (wrapped in cloth, not applied directly) may be used in the first 6 hours for comfort and bruising reduction.

**Medications:**
- **Avoid NSAIDs for 48 hours** (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) — increases bruising risk.
- Use paracetamol for pain relief.
- Continue all prescribed medications unless the MD has advised otherwise.

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for **48 hours** post-treatment.

---

## 4.3 Optimising Results

- Attend your 4-week review — this is when the result is properly assessed and any minor asymmetry or texture concerns can be addressed.
- Maintain consistent moulding massage from Day 3 to Day 21 as shown.
- If you notice a firm nodule forming between Week 1 and Week 4 — contact the clinic immediately. Do not try to massage it out aggressively. Early treatment is more effective than delayed management.
- Avoid extreme weight fluctuation — significant weight change affects fat distribution in the area and the appearance of the filler.

---

## 4.4 Emergency Red Flags — Seek Immediate Medical Attention (999 / A&E)

These warning signs may indicate a vascular emergency — penile blood supply being compromised. This is the most serious complication of this procedure. **Act immediately. Do not wait.**

🔴 **White, pale, or grey discolouration of any area of the penile shaft** — loss of blood supply. Call 999. Tell A&E you have had penile filler and may have a vascular occlusion. Contact the clinic immediately so your Practitioner can meet you or guide first responders.

🔴 **Dark purple, blue, or black discolouration** — late sign of ischaemia. Call 999 immediately.

🔴 **Sudden severe disproportionate pain — far beyond the expected post-procedure soreness** — may indicate vascular compromise or haematoma requiring urgent drainage. Call 999.

🔴 **Rapidly expanding haematoma (swelling that grows significantly within minutes)** — urgent A&E.

🔴 **Cold area or cold sensation on the shaft** — loss of circulation. Call 999.

🔴 **Rash, throat tightening, difficulty breathing, or collapse** — anaphylaxis. Call 999.

🔴 **Fever >38°C within 72 hours, with increasing redness and pain** — may indicate deep infection. A&E urgently.

> **When calling 999 or presenting to A&E:** Tell them you have had hyaluronic acid filler injected into the penile shaft. Tell them you may have a vascular occlusion. Ask them to consider hyaluronidase injection. Give them this aftercare sheet.
