**Menhancements | Clinical Pathway Document**
**Reference:** MEN-CP-009 | **Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 2026-02-24
**Author:** Manchester Medical Director | **Review Date:** 2027-02-24
**Classification:** CLINICAL — RESTRICTED

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

IV Micronutrient Therapy delivers vitamins, minerals, and co-factors directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing first-pass gastrointestinal absorption. At therapeutic IV doses, plasma concentrations of ascorbic acid, magnesium, B-vitamins, and NAD+ precursors significantly exceed what is achievable orally. Indications include optimisation of energy metabolism, immune function, athletic recovery, hangover resolution, and adjunctive management of documented micronutrient deficiency states. All injectable preparations administered at Menhancements are Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) or unlicensed specials sourced from MHRA-licensed specials manufacturers; no infusion proceeds without a valid, patient-specific, signed prescription from the Manchester Medical Director (MD). The procedure requires IV cannulation by a competency-verified practitioner, continuous monitoring throughout the infusion, and immediate access to anaphylaxis management equipment at the treatment location. This pathway applies to all Menhancements clinic locations: **Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan**.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — ALL COMPONENTS ARE PRESCRIPTION-ONLY OR UNLICENSED SPECIALS**
> Every constituent of every IV infusion protocol (including vitamins, minerals, and co-factors in injectable form) is a Prescription-Only Medicine (POM) under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, or an unlicensed special. Unlicensed preparations (glutathione, NAD+) require supply exclusively via an MHRA-licensed specials manufacturer. No infusion bag may be opened or administered without a valid, patient-specific, signed MD prescription on file. Protocol-driven or batch prescribing is not permitted.

> **NOTICE 2 — ANAPHYLAXIS RISK: RESUSCITATION EQUIPMENT IS A MANDATORY PRE-TREATMENT GATE**
> Intravenous administration of vitamins and minerals — including thiamine (Pabrinex), B-complex, and ascorbic acid — carries a material risk of systemic anaphylaxis, including fatal anaphylaxis. Adrenaline (epinephrine) 1:1000 (300 mcg auto-injector or 0.5 mL of 1:1000 pre-drawn) and full anaphylaxis management equipment MUST be physically present in the treatment room before any cannula is inserted. Any treatment location that cannot meet this requirement must not offer IV therapy. Practitioners must hold a current anaphylaxis management certification.

> **NOTICE 3 — G6PD DEFICIENCY: ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATION FOR HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN C**
> Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes acute haemolytic anaemia in response to ascorbic acid ≥7.5g IV. G6PD status must be confirmed negative (laboratory result on file, reviewed by MD) before any high-dose vitamin C protocol (Package B). If G6PD status is unknown, the maximum permissible ascorbic acid dose is 2g (standard Myers' Cocktail ceiling) until screening is complete.

> **NOTICE 4 — RENAL AND CARDIAC HARD GATES**
> Patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m², active or decompensated cardiac failure, or presenting blood pressure >180/110 mmHg are absolutely contraindicated for IV fluid loading. IV administration risks fluid overload, electrolyte disturbance, and acute cardiac or renal decompensation in this cohort. Baseline renal function and cardiovascular history must be reviewed by the MD prior to first infusion. Ongoing monitoring of renal function is required for patients receiving repeat infusions at high volume.

> **NOTICE 5 — NAD+ AND GLUTATHIONE ARE UNLICENSED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM**
> NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and glutathione injectables do not hold MHRA product authorisation for any indication. Supply must be sourced exclusively from an MHRA-licensed specials manufacturer; batch numbers and manufacturer details must be recorded in the patient treatment record for every infusion. Patients must receive specific unlicensed medicine counselling prior to first administration and provide separate documented consent. The MD must record clinical justification for each unlicensed component in the patient record.

## PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

### 1.1 Scope and Treatment Indications

This pathway governs the prescription, preparation, administration, and monitoring of intravenous micronutrient infusions at all Menhancements clinic locations.

**Recognised clinical indications:**

| Category | Clinical Rationale |
|---|---|
| Documented micronutrient deficiency | Laboratory-confirmed deficiency in B12, magnesium, vitamin C, or zinc with symptomatic presentation |
| Athletic performance and recovery | Accelerated muscle recovery, oxidative stress reduction, electrolyte replenishment |
| Energy and cognitive optimisation | Fatigue, cognitive fog, sub-optimal mitochondrial function (NAD+ pathway support) |
| Immune function support | Peri-illness high-dose vitamin C; recurrent infection history |
| Hangover and acute dehydration | Rapid IV rehydration with electrolyte and B-vitamin replacement |
| Post-surgical or post-illness repletion | Accelerated restoration of depleted micronutrient stores |

> **Clinical Boundary:** IV micronutrient therapy is not a substitute for medical diagnosis. Patients presenting with symptoms attributable to a specific pathology must be referred to their GP or relevant specialist. This service is adjunctive and optimisation-focused, not diagnostic or curative. If the MD identifies a presentation requiring further medical investigation, the treatment is deferred pending GP review.

---

### 1.2 Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Clinical Rationale |
|---|---|
| Known allergy to any infusion component | Anaphylaxis risk — formulation must be modified; do not substitute without new MD prescription |
| eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m² (severe CKD / renal failure) | Fluid and electrolyte overload; renal clearance of water-soluble vitamins severely impaired |
| Decompensated cardiac failure (any class) | IV fluid loading precipitates acute pulmonary oedema |
| Active uncontrolled hypertension (BP >180/110 mmHg at presentation) | Fluid loading risks acute hypertensive crisis; cardiovascular decompensation |
| G6PD deficiency | High-dose ascorbic acid (≥7.5g IV) causes acute haemolytic anaemia — potentially life-threatening |
| Active malignancy (without documented oncology clearance) | High-dose vitamin C and NAD+ have uncertain interactions with oncological treatment protocols |
| Active systemic infection (temperature >38°C at assessment) | IV cannula creates portal of entry; systemic sepsis risk in immunocompromised state |
| Active, untreated DVT or confirmed hypercoagulable disorder | IV access may propagate existing thrombus |
| Haemochromatosis | Absolute contraindication to any iron-containing preparation |
| Active or recent (within 3 months) IVDU (intravenous drug use) | Venous access compromised; safeguarding concern — refer to specialist substance misuse service |
| Current post-transplant immunosuppression | High-dose ascorbic acid may interfere with calcineurin inhibitors; NAD+ interactions not established |

---

### 1.3 Relative Contraindications (Mandatory MD Assessment Before Proceeding)

| Contraindication | Required Action |
|---|---|
| eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73m² (moderate CKD) | MD individual risk/benefit assessment; restrict infusion volume to ≤250 mL; avoid high-dose magnesium |
| Controlled hypertension (BP 140–180/90–110 mmHg at presentation) | MD review; restrict volume to ≤250 mL; 15-minute BP monitoring interval during infusion |
| History of calcium oxalate kidney stones | High-dose vitamin C is metabolised to oxalate; restrict ascorbic acid to ≤2g per session |
| Anticoagulant therapy (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) | Higher haematoma risk at cannula site; 5 minutes manual pressure post-decannulation; document |
| Insulin-treated diabetes mellitus | Blood glucose monitoring during infusion; some preparations contain dextrose — check formulation |
| Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy | Hydroxocobalamin (B12) is contraindicated; cyanocobalamin must also be excluded; flag to MD |
| Thyroid disorder (levothyroxine) | Minimum 4-hour gap from last levothyroxine dose before B-vitamin infusion; document |
| Needle phobia or history of vasovagal syncope | Treat supine; ensure patient has eaten; observe closely during cannulation; have oral glucose available |
| First infusion (any patient) | Treat as potential first-exposure anaphylaxis event; slower infusion rate; continuous observation for first 5 minutes |

### 1.6 Prescribing and Consultation Pathway (MD-Practitioner Split)

> The prescriber-practitioner split is absolute. No IV infusion component is administered without a valid individual MD prescription. Practitioners do not prescribe.

| Stage | Responsible Party | Location | Required Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Enquiry and booking | Admin / Practitioner | Any location | Pre-consultation questionnaire issued; bloods ordered if first-time patient |
| 2. Clinical assessment | Practitioner | Clinic (Manchester / Leeds / Wilmslow / Wigan) | Full history; contraindication screen; baseline observations (BP, HR, SpO₂, temperature); findings transmitted to MD |
| 3. MD consultation | Manchester Medical Director | Manchester or remote (synchronous) | Reviews history and observations; confirms indication; screens for absolute CIs; requests any outstanding bloods; determines formulation |
| 4. MD prescription issued | Manchester Medical Director | Manchester | Patient-specific, signed, dated prescription naming each component, dose, volume, rate, and infusion time |
| 5. Prescription verification | Practitioner | Clinic | Two-point check: prescription vs. prepared infusion bag — patient name, DOB, component, dose, expiry |
| 6. Aseptic preparation | Practitioner | Clinic | ANTT throughout; all additions to carrier bag via sterile technique; label applied |
| 7. IV administration | Practitioner | Clinic | Cannulation, infusion, and monitoring per this SOP |
| 8. Adverse event notification | Practitioner → MD | Emergency escalation pathway | Immediate (see Section 1.12) |

**Mandatory Blood Tests Before First Infusion (MD Review Required):**

| Test | Applicability |
|---|---|
| eGFR / serum creatinine | All patients |
| G6PD enzyme activity | All patients — mandatory gate before Package B |
| FBC (full blood count) | All patients |
| LFTs (liver function tests) | Patients requesting NAD+ or glutathione |
| Fasting glucose | Patients with diabetes or suspected dysregulation |
| Serum magnesium | Patients with cardiac history before magnesium-containing infusions |
| Serum B12 (baseline) | All patients requesting B12-containing protocols |
| Serum zinc (baseline) | Patients requesting repeated zinc infusions |

### 1.7 Pre-Treatment Preparation — Day of Treatment

**Day-of Checklist (Practitioner — All Items Must Pass Before Cannula Is Inserted):**

| # | Check | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | MD prescription on file — patient-specific, signed, dated, within valid period | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 2 | Unlicensed consent signed (if NAD+ or glutathione included) | ☐ Pass / ☐ N/A |
| 3 | G6PD result (negative) documented by MD (Package B ≥7.5g only) | ☐ Pass / ☐ N/A |
| 4 | Baseline observations recorded: BP, HR, SpO₂, temperature | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 5 | Anaphylaxis equipment present, in-date, and accessible in treatment room | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 6 | Infusion components verified against prescription (name, dose, expiry, volume) — two-point check | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 7 | Batch numbers and expiry dates of all components logged in patient record | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 8 | Patient has eaten within 2 hours (prevents hypoglycaemia during infusion) | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 9 | Informed consent signed and copy issued to patient | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 10 | Emergency contact number confirmed in HubSpot patient record | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 11 | Patient wearing accessible clothing (loose sleeve / gown) for IV access | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |

> **Any failed check = STOP. Do not insert cannula. Resolve the failed item or escalate to MD before proceeding.**

---

### 1.8 IV Cannulation Protocol

**Patient Positioning:** Supine preferred for first infusion or any patient with needle phobia or history of vasovagal syncope. Seated position acceptable for experienced patients with no history of fainting.

**Cannulation Procedure:**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Perform hand hygiene — WHO 6-step technique. Apply non-sterile gloves. |
| 2 | Assess vein: antecubital fossa (basilic, cephalic, or median cubital vein) preferred for all infusion volumes. Dorsal hand veins acceptable only for short infusions (≤100 mL) or glutathione push. Avoid veins overlying joints where possible. |
| 3 | Apply tourniquet 5–10 cm proximal to intended cannulation site. Palpate and visually assess vein quality. |
| 4 | Clean site with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe. Allow minimum 30 seconds to air dry. Do not fan, blow, or wipe after cleaning. |
| 5 | Insert cannula (20G/22G) at 10–15° angle, bevel up. Advance until flashback is visible in cannula chamber. |
| 6 | Lower angle to near-parallel with skin. Advance the cannula into the vein while partially withdrawing the needle. |
| 7 | Release tourniquet. Advance cannula fully into vein. Remove needle. Cap or attach sterile extension set immediately. |
| 8 | Flush with 10 mL 0.9% NaCl — confirm patency. Resistance, swelling, or pain indicates infiltration — remove and re-site. |
| 9 | Secure cannula with transparent Tegaderm dressing. Apply date-and-time label. |
| 10 | Dispose of needle immediately into sharps bin at point of use. |
| 11 | Document: gauge used, insertion site, time, patent status, and patient tolerance. |

**Failed Cannulation Protocol:**

- Maximum **two attempts** per practitioner per session.
- After two failed attempts: inform MD; offer rebooking. Do not apply further attempts.
- Three or more cannulation attempts in a single session is a clinical governance breach — document and report.

---

### 1.9 Infusion Administration Protocol

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Prepare infusion bag aseptically (ANTT). Add all prescribed components to carrier bag via sterile technique. Label bag: patient name, DOB, contents, doses, batch numbers, date, time prepared, prepared by. |
| 2 | Prime giving set: spike bag, open roller clamp until fluid runs to the tip of the giving set (expelling all air), close clamp. Inspect for visible bubbles — re-prime if air remains. |
| 3 | Connect primed giving set to cannula extension set. Confirm secure connection. |
| 4 | Open clamp to set flow rate per MD prescription (drops/min or mL/hr). Document rate in treatment log. |
| 5 | Commence infusion. Record start time in observation log. |
| 6 | Observe patient continuously for the first 5 minutes. Specifically assess for: flushing, urticaria, pruritus, respiratory distress, chest tightness, nausea, tachycardia, hypotension. Any of these symptoms triggers emergency assessment. |
| 7 | Thereafter, monitor at 10–15 minute intervals: BP, HR, SpO₂, visual assessment of cannula site (check for infiltration, phlebitis signs). |
| 8 | All observations recorded in the time-stamped treatment log. |
| 9 | On infusion completion: flush cannula with 10 mL 0.9% NaCl. Disconnect giving set. |
| 10 | Remove cannula: gentle pressure with sterile gauze for minimum 2 minutes (5 minutes if patient is anticoagulated). Apply adhesive dressing. |
| 11 | Record: end time, total volume delivered, patient subjective response, any observations or concerns. |

**Infusion Rate Reference (Adjust Per MD Prescription — These Are Defaults Only):**

| Package | Default Rate | Approximate Duration | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Myers' Cocktail (250 mL) | 80–100 mL/hr | 45–60 min | — |
| High-Dose Vit C 7.5g (250 mL) | 60–80 mL/hr | 90–120 min | — |
| High-Dose Vit C ≥15g (250 mL) | 50–60 mL/hr | 150–180 min | Slower to reduce phlebitis risk |
| NAD+ 250 mg in 250 mL | 80–100 mL/hr | 90–120 min | Titrate to patient tolerance |
| NAD+ 500–1000 mg in 250 mL | 50–60 mL/hr | 2–4 hours | Slow. Pause (do not stop) if nausea/chest tightness |
| Athletic Recovery (500 mL) | 100–150 mL/hr | 60–90 min | — |
| Hydration (500 mL) | 250–500 mL/hr | 60–120 min | Rate adjusted to clinical need |
| Glutathione Push | Manual push: 5–10 minutes minimum | — | Never bolus. Dilute in NaCl. |

### 1.10 Monitoring During Infusion

**Mandatory Observation Schedule:**

| Time Point | Observations Required |
|---|---|
| 0 min (commencement) | BP, HR, SpO₂, temperature, cannula site visual check — record in log |
| 5 min | HR, SpO₂, subjective patient assessment ("How are you feeling?") |
| 15 min | BP, HR, SpO₂, cannula site check |
| 30 min | BP, HR, SpO₂ |
| 60 min | BP, HR, SpO₂, cannula site check |
| On completion | BP, HR, SpO₂, patient subjective response |
| 15 min post-completion | BP, HR, SpO₂ — minimum observation before discharge |

> For NAD+ protocols (2–4 hours): observations every 15 minutes for the first 60 minutes, then every 30 minutes thereafter.

**Alert Thresholds — Trigger Emergency Protocol Immediately:**

| Parameter | Alert Threshold |
|---|---|
| SpO₂ | <94% at any point |
| Systolic BP | <90 mmHg or sudden drop >30 mmHg from baseline |
| Systolic BP | >200 mmHg at any point |
| HR | <50 bpm or >120 bpm |
| Temperature | >38°C during or after infusion |
| Any urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, or stridor | Immediate — anaphylaxis protocol |
| Sudden chest pain, dyspnoea, or collapse | Immediate — anaphylaxis or air embolism protocol |
| Cannula site: swelling, pallor, coolness, pain | Stop infusion — infiltration protocol |
| Cannula site: erythema, warmth, streak proximal to site | Slow/stop — phlebitis assessment |

---

### 1.11 Emergency Management

#### A. Anaphylaxis Protocol

**Recognition:** Urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, tachycardia, or loss of consciousness — any combination following infusion commencement.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | STOP infusion immediately. Clamp giving set. Do NOT remove cannula — IV access must be preserved for emergency drug administration. |
| 2 | Call 999. State: "Anaphylaxis following IV infusion at [full clinic address]." |
| 3 | Position: lay flat, elevate legs. If respiratory distress is dominant, sit patient up. |
| 4 | Administer adrenaline 0.5 mL 1:1000 IM — anterolateral mid-thigh preferred. EpiPen/Jext auto-injector acceptable. |
| 5 | Administer high-flow oxygen 10–15 L/min via non-rebreather mask. |
| 6 | Administer chlorphenamine 10 mg IM (MD prescription on file). |
| 7 | Administer hydrocortisone 200 mg IV/IM (MD prescription on file). |
| 8 | Monitor BP, HR, SpO₂ every 2–3 minutes. |
| 9 | Repeat adrenaline 0.5 mL IM at 5 minutes if no clinical improvement. |
| 10 | Activate automated emergency escalation (Section 1.12). |
| 11 | Brief arriving paramedics: infusion start time, all components, doses, batch numbers, onset timeline, all interventions administered. Provide copy of MD prescription. |
| 12 | File MHRA Yellow Card within 24 hours. |
| 13 | Mandatory MD debrief and incident report in clinical governance system within 24 hours. Patient must not receive the implicated component again without MD senior review. |

#### B. Air Embolism Protocol

**Recognition:** Sudden dyspnoea, chest pain, hypotension, altered consciousness — particularly if air was observed in giving set during priming or administration.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | STOP infusion. Clamp giving set immediately. |
| 2 | Position: left lateral decubitus (Durant's manoeuvre) + Trendelenburg (head down). This traps air in the right ventricle and prevents pulmonary migration. |
| 3 | Call 999 immediately. |
| 4 | Administer high-flow oxygen 10–15 L/min. |
| 5 | Monitor vitals continuously. Maintain position. |
| 6 | Activate automated emergency escalation (Section 1.12). |
| 7 | Do not leave patient alone under any circumstances. |
| 8 | Document: estimated volume of air visible, infusion volume delivered, time of onset, vital signs at each time point. MHRA Yellow Card and full incident report. |

#### C. Extravasation Protocol

**Recognition:** Localised swelling, pallor, coolness, tightness, or pain at or around the cannula site during infusion. Absence of blood flashback on aspiration.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | STOP infusion immediately. |
| 2 | Attempt to aspirate residual fluid (5–10 mL) via the in-situ cannula before removal — reduces volume of extravasated solution. |
| 3 | Remove cannula. Apply gentle pressure with sterile gauze — do not rub. |
| 4 | Elevate the affected limb above heart level. |
| 5 | Apply cool compress (cloth-wrapped ice pack — not ice directly to skin) for 20 minutes. |
| 6 | Photograph the site. Document estimated extravasated volume, solution composition, and visual appearance. |
| 7 | Most saline and vitamin extravasations are low harm — observe for 30 minutes for resolution. |
| 8 | High-dose ascorbic acid extravasation: monitor for tissue irritation; advise patient to report increasing pain or skin changes. |
| 9 | Escalate to MD if any doubt about volume extravasated or patient reports worsening symptoms. |
| 10 | Do not re-attempt IV cannulation in the same limb within the same session. |

#### D. Phlebitis Protocol

**Recognition:** Erythema, warmth, induration, pain at or proximal to cannula site, or red streak tracking along the vein.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Assess severity using the Visual Infusion Phlebitis (VIP) Score (0–5). |
| 2 | VIP score 1–2: slow infusion rate; apply warm compress; if persistent after 10 minutes, stop and re-site. |
| 3 | VIP score ≥3: STOP infusion. Remove cannula. Apply warm compress. Do not restart in same vein. |
| 4 | Document site appearance, VIP score, action taken, time. |
| 5 | Advise patient on signs of progressive phlebitis or thrombophlebitis (increasing pain, spreading redness, hardening of the vein). |
| 6 | Review infusion osmolarity and rate — relay to MD for consideration of formulation modification at next session. |
| 7 | If septic phlebitis is suspected (fever >38°C, rigors, purulent discharge from site): activate emergency escalation; call 999. Do not attempt re-site. |

### 3.1 Description of Treatment

I consent to receiving intravenous (IV) micronutrient therapy at Menhancements. I understand this involves insertion of a peripheral IV cannula (a short plastic tube placed in a vein) in my arm, through which a prescribed solution of vitamins, minerals, and/or co-factors will be delivered directly into my bloodstream over an approximate duration of 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the protocol selected.

**Treatment packages consented to today:**

☐ Myers' Cocktail (Package A)
☐ High-Dose Vitamin C — Immune Optimisation (Package B)
☐ NAD+ — Energy and Neurological Optimisation (Package C)
☐ Glutathione Push — Antioxidant (Package D)
☐ Athletic Performance and Recovery (Package E)
☐ Hydration and Hangover Recovery (Package F)
☐ Bespoke formulation: _______________________________________________

---

### 3.2 Off-Label and Unlicensed Use Disclosure

**All injectable vitamin and mineral preparations administered at Menhancements are used off-label.** While the individual pharmaceutical components (ascorbic acid, hydroxocobalamin, magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate, B-complex vitamins) are licensed medicines in the UK, their intravenous administration for wellness optimisation, athletic performance, and energy enhancement falls outside the licensed indications for these products. The Manchester Medical Director has assessed my clinical circumstances and determined that the clinical benefits are likely to outweigh the risks.

**NAD+ and glutathione are unlicensed medicines in the United Kingdom.** There is no MHRA product authorisation for injectable NAD+ or glutathione for any indication. These preparations are sourced from MHRA-licensed specials manufacturers. Clinical evidence supports their use in specific metabolic and neurocognitive contexts; however, the evidence base is less established than for licensed medicines. I consent to receive these preparations with full awareness of their unlicensed status.

| Preparation | UK Licensing Status | Patient Initials |
|---|---|---|
| Injectable vitamins and minerals | Licensed POM, administered off-label for wellness | _______ |
| NAD+ (if applicable) | Unlicensed special — specific additional consent | _______ |
| Glutathione (if applicable) | Unlicensed special — specific additional consent | _______ |

---

### 3.3 Risks and Potential Complications

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Pain, bruising, or haematoma at cannula site | Very common (1 in 5) | Mild, self-resolving |
| Failed cannulation requiring second attempt | Common | Mild |
| Localised phlebitis (vein inflammation) | Uncommon (1 in 20) | Mild to moderate |
| Extravasation (fluid leaking outside vein) | Uncommon | Usually mild and self-resolving |
| Vasovagal syncope (fainting) during cannulation | Uncommon | Mild to moderate |
| Nausea, flushing, warmth, headache during infusion | Common with NAD+ (infusion rate-dependent) | Mild |
| Unusual taste (metallic, vitamin-like) during infusion | Common | Mild, transient |
| Mild hypoglycaemia (lightheadedness, shakiness) | Uncommon | Mild |
| Allergic reaction (urticaria, rash) | Uncommon (1 in 50) | Moderate |
| Anaphylaxis (severe systemic allergic reaction) | Rare (<1 in 1,000) | **Potentially life-threatening** |
| Air embolism (air entering bloodstream) | Rare (with technique errors; ANTT protocol prevents) | **Potentially life-threatening** |
| Infection / sepsis | Rare (with ANTT failures) | **Potentially life-threatening** |
| Haemolytic anaemia (undetected G6PD + high-dose Vit C) | Rare — mitigated by mandatory G6PD screening | Serious |
| Fluid overload (in undetected cardiac/renal disease) | Rare — mitigated by mandatory screening | Serious |
| Peripheral neuropathy (chronic high-dose B6) | Rare at doses used in this protocol | Serious |
| Thrombophlebitis / superficial DVT | Rare | Serious |

### 3.4 Realistic Outcome Expectations

I understand and accept the following:

- IV micronutrient therapy is **not a licensed medical treatment** for any specific diagnosed condition and is offered as a wellness and optimisation service.
- Any perceived benefit in energy levels, cognitive function, immune response, or athletic recovery is **subjective and not guaranteed**. Individual response varies significantly.
- A single infusion provides temporary elevation of circulating micronutrient levels. This is not a substitute for sustained dietary optimisation, physical conditioning, adequate sleep, or medical treatment of underlying diagnosed conditions.
- Menhancements does not make therapeutic claims for IV therapy beyond adjunctive micronutrient optimisation.
- If the Manchester Medical Director identifies that my presenting symptoms may indicate an underlying medical condition requiring diagnosis, treatment will be deferred and I will be referred to my GP or appropriate specialist.

## PART 4: AFTERCARE PROTOCOL — MEN-CP-009

**Patient Copy — Issue at Discharge**

---

### 4.1 Immediately After Your Infusion

You will remain in the clinic for a **minimum of 15 minutes** post-infusion before discharge. Do not leave before the practitioner formally discharges you.

It is normal to experience a mild sense of warmth, flushing, or a vitamin taste in the mouth during or immediately after the infusion — this resolves quickly. Some patients notice a brief elevation in energy or alertness; others feel relaxed or slightly fatigued, particularly after NAD+ or higher-dose protocols.

**NAD+ specific:** Temporary nausea, headache, muscle cramps, or fatigue following NAD+ infusion are common and self-limiting. Rest and hydrate. These effects typically resolve within 1–3 hours.

---

### 4.2 First 24 Hours

- **Hydration:** Drink a minimum of 1.5–2 litres of water over the remainder of the day. IV therapy enhances intracellular hydration; oral fluid intake supports this.
- **Cannula site:** Keep the adhesive plaster in place for at least 30 minutes. Minor bruising or a small lump at the site is normal.
- **Activity:** Light activity is fine. Avoid strenuous exercise for 4–6 hours to allow your body to utilise the delivered nutrients.
- **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol for a minimum of 12 hours post-infusion — particularly important following B-vitamin and NAD+ protocols.
- **Driving:** You are fit to drive immediately after your infusion unless you feel lightheaded or unsteady. If in any doubt, wait 30 minutes before driving.
- **Urine colour:** Expect bright yellow urine for up to 48 hours — this is the riboflavin (B2) in your infusion and is completely normal.

---

### 4.3 Expected Side Effects

These are normal and self-limiting:

| Side Effect | Expected Duration |
|---|---|
| Mild bruising at cannula site | 3–7 days |
| Small lump or firmness at cannula site | 3–5 days |
| Flushing or sensation of warmth | 30–60 minutes |
| Unusual metallic or vitamin taste | 30–60 minutes |
| Mild headache (post-NAD+) | 2–4 hours |
| Nausea (post-NAD+) | 1–3 hours |
| Fatigue or "come-down" feeling (post-NAD+) | Up to 24 hours |
| Increased frequency of urination | 2–4 hours (fluid + diuretic effect of high-dose vitamin C) |
| Vivid bright yellow urine | 24–48 hours (riboflavin/B2 — entirely normal) |

---

### 4.4 Red Flag Symptoms — Call 999 Immediately

**Do not wait. Do not drive yourself to hospital. Do not contact the clinic first — call 999.**

- Difficulty breathing or sudden shortness of breath
- Throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, or voice change
- Chest pain or chest tightness
- Heart racing, pounding, or irregular heartbeat
- Severe rash, hives, or sudden widespread skin reaction
- Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
- Loss of consciousness or extreme dizziness / collapse
- A red streak tracking up your arm from the cannula site (possible spreading infection)
- High fever (>38°C) or shaking chills (rigors) within 24 hours of your infusion
- Increasing pain, swelling, or heat at the cannula site worsening after 24 hours

**After calling 999, contact the Menhancements emergency line: [CLINIC EMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBER]**

---

### 4.5 Cannula Site Care

| Timeframe | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 0–30 minutes post-treatment | Keep adhesive plaster in place |
| 30 minutes | Remove plaster if there is no active bleeding |
| 1–24 hours | Mild bruising and minor swelling are normal; do not rub or apply heat |
| 24–72 hours | Bruising may darken before fading — this is a normal healing response |
| Any time | If the site becomes increasingly painful, hot, red, or swollen, or if you see a red streak → contact the clinic or NHS 111 |

---

### 4.6 Repeat Infusions

The frequency of IV therapy is determined by the Manchester Medical Director based on your individual clinical profile, results, and treatment goals. **A valid MD prescription must be in place for each session.** Contact the clinic to book your MD review and repeat prescription.

**Indicative repeat frequencies (for guidance only — MD determines individually):**

| Protocol | Indicative Frequency |
|---|---|
| Myers' Cocktail / Hydration | Every 2–4 weeks |
| High-Dose Vitamin C | Every 1–2 weeks (during illness) or monthly (maintenance) |
| NAD+ (loading phase) | Weekly for 4 sessions |
| NAD+ (maintenance) | Monthly |
| Glutathione push | Every 2–4 weeks, as adjunct |
| Athletic Recovery | As needed peri-event; monthly maintenance |

> Repeat infusions are not automatic and are not issued on a standing order. Each session requires a valid in-date MD prescription.
