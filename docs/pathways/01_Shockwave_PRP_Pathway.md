# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Linear Focused Shockwave Therapy (LFSWT) + Platelet-Rich Plasma (P-Shot)
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-001 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of combined Linear Focused Shockwave Therapy (LFSWT) and Platelet-Rich Plasma penile injection (P-Shot) at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. The combination protocol targets vasculogenic and psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED), Peyronie's disease-associated fibrosis, and suboptimal erectile quality in men seeking evidence-based, non-pharmacological optimisation.

**Pathway Summary:** All patients undergo a structured two-stage consultation process. The treating Practitioner conducts an initial clinical assessment. Where Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) are required — specifically topical and/or injectable anaesthetics — the Manchester Medical Director (MD) conducts a mandatory remote or in-person prescribing consultation prior to treatment commencement. The MD prescribes; the Practitioner delivers. No treatment proceeds without MD prescribing sign-off.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context and maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023).

# PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

---

## 1.1 Treatment Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment 1** | Linear Focused Shockwave Therapy (LFSWT) |
| **Treatment 2** | Platelet-Rich Plasma Injection — Penile (P-Shot / Priapus Shot) |
| **Delivery Model** | Combined in a single session OR staged (LFSWT first; PRP 1–2 weeks later). MD determines sequencing at prescribing consultation. |
| **Mechanism — LFSWT** | Low-intensity linear focused acoustic waves stimulate neovascularisation, endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and dissolution of fibrotic plaques within the corpora cavernosa and penile vasculature. |
| **Mechanism — PRP** | Autologous platelet-rich plasma delivers concentrated growth factors (PDGF, TGF-β1, VEGF, IGF-1) directly into penile tissue to stimulate tissue regeneration, collagen remodelling, and angiogenesis. |
| **Session Protocol** | LFSWT: 6–12 sessions (1–2× per week). PRP: 1–3 injections (4–8 weeks apart). |
| **Evidence Base** | ISSM (International Society for Sexual Medicine) guidelines; EAU (European Association of Urology) position on ESWT; multiple RCTs (Vardi et al., Kitrey et al., Poulakis et al.) |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

## 1.5 Consultation & Prescribing Pathway

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, or Wigan)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 30–45 minutes

The Practitioner completes the Dynamic Consultation Form (see Part 2) and:

1. Records presenting complaint, ED history, duration, and prior treatments
2. Administers IIEF-5 and EHS validated tools — records baseline scores
3. Conducts relevant medical history, medication review, and contraindication screen
4. Reviews any existing bloods (full blood count, testosterone, HbA1c, lipid profile, PSA if >50 or indicated)
5. Determines treatment suitability in principle and flags any relative contraindications
6. **Does NOT prescribe any POMs**
7. Completes the "MD Referral Trigger Checklist" (embedded in consultation form) and transmits to Manchester MD via secure clinical platform

### STAGE 2 — Manchester Medical Director Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation (preferred) OR in-person at Manchester clinic
**Mandatory for:** ALL patients requiring EMLA cream and/or injectable anaesthetic

The MD:
1. Reviews the Practitioner's completed assessment and referral notes
2. Conducts independent clinical assessment (remote or in-person)
3. Confirms or modifies treatment suitability
4. Issues written POM prescription for:
   - EMLA cream (lidocaine 2.5% / prilocaine 2.5%) as topical anaesthetic
   - Injectable lidocaine (if dorsal nerve block is the chosen anaesthetic method)
5. Documents prescribing rationale and clinical justification in patient record
6. Signs off the treatment plan — countersigned in digital system
7. **Does NOT perform the physical treatment**

> **CRITICAL RULE:** No POM-dependent treatment session may commence without a valid MD prescription on the patient record. The Practitioner must verify prescription is present in the digital record before opening any POM packaging.

### STAGE 3 — Treatment Delivery

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (at clinic location)
**Proceeds only after:** MD prescription confirmed; Informed Consent signed; no new contraindications identified on day

---

## 1.6 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT (All Steps Mandatory)

**P-1.** Verify patient identity against digital record (full name + date of birth).

**P-2.** Confirm valid MD prescription is on file for all POMs (EMLA / injectable anaesthetic). If absent — **STOP. Contact MD immediately. Do not proceed.**

**P-3.** Confirm signed Informed Consent Document (Part 3) is on file. Patient must re-confirm verbal consent on the day.

**P-4.** Review consultation form for any new symptoms or medication changes since assessment. If new contraindications are identified — **STOP. Contact MD before proceeding.**

**P-5.** Room preparation: treatment couch with disposable paper cover, good directional lighting, clinical waste and sharps disposal positioned appropriately, all equipment laid on sterile field.

**P-6.** Patient privacy: door secured, blinds/screens closed, patient dignity preserved throughout.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA ANAESTHETIC APPLICATION

**Step 1.** Gently cleanse the penile shaft and glans with warm water. Pat dry.

**Step 2.** Apply EMLA cream (as prescribed by MD) generously to the entire penile shaft and glans. Apply a thick, occlusive layer.

**Step 3.** Cover with Tegaderm or cling film occlusive dressing. Record application time in digital record.

**Step 4.** Wait minimum **60 minutes** for full anaesthetic effect. Patient may remain dressed and seated/reclining during this period.

**Step 5.** At 60 minutes: remove dressing and cream. Confirm adequate anaesthesia by light touch test. If inadequate — **wait additional 15 minutes and retest. Do not proceed if anaesthesia is insufficient.**

---

### PHASE 2 — LINEAR FOCUSED SHOCKWAVE THERAPY (LFSWT)

> LFSWT is delivered FIRST in the combined protocol to maximise vasodilation and tissue receptivity for PRP.

**Step 6.** Apply ultrasound coupling gel (single-use sachet) to the penile shaft.

**Step 7.** Configure device to prescribed protocol:
- Energy flux density: 0.05–0.25 mJ/mm² (commence at lower range for first session; titrate per tolerance)
- Pulse frequency: 10–15 Hz
- Number of pulses: 1,000–3,000 per session (per MD-approved protocol)
- Treatment zones: bilateral lateral shaft (3 and 9 o'clock positions), dorsal shaft, penoscrotal junction, and crural regions as indicated

**Step 8.** Apply handpiece firmly to first treatment zone. Deliver pulses in slow, linear sweeping motion — do NOT hold static.

**Step 9.** Move systematically through all treatment zones. Record pulse count per zone in digital record.

**Step 10.** Monitor patient tolerance throughout. If patient reports sharp pain (distinguish from dull acoustic pressure, which is expected) — reduce energy level or pause.

**Step 11.** At completion: wipe gel from shaft. Inspect skin integrity. Document any redness, petechiae, or bruising (minor superficial redness is expected and acceptable).

**Step 12.** Allow 10-minute rest period before commencing PRP phase.

---

### PHASE 3 — PRP PREPARATION (VENEPUNCTURE & CENTRIFUGATION)

**Step 13.** Prepare venepuncture site — antecubital fossa (preferred) or alternative site per patient anatomy. Apply tourniquet. Cleanse with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe. Allow to dry.

**Step 14.** Perform venepuncture. Draw blood into PRP-specific ACD-A vacutainer tubes per manufacturer volume requirement (typically 30–60 mL whole blood across 4–8 tubes).

**Step 15.** Remove tourniquet. Apply pressure. Confirm haemostasis. Apply dressing.

**Step 16.** Label tubes with patient ID and date/time. Load into centrifuge immediately.

**Step 17.** Run centrifuge per validated protocol:
- Spin 1: 1,500 RPM × 5 minutes (separates red cells from buffy coat and plasma)
- Spin 2: 2,500 RPM × 10 minutes (concentrates platelets into PRP pellet/fraction)
- (Confirm exact parameters against your centrifuge IFU — document device and protocol used)

**Step 18.** Under aseptic technique, extract PRP fraction into 3 mL sterile syringe. Volume typically 2–5 mL concentrated PRP. Do not activate with calcium chloride unless activation protocol is MD-specified.

**Step 19.** Visually inspect PRP — should appear straw-yellow to pale amber. If contaminated with red cells — discard and document. Do not inject haemolysed or visually abnormal PRP.

---

### PHASE 4 — PRP INJECTION (P-SHOT)

**Step 20.** Confirm anaesthesia is still effective (or re-apply as needed per MD prescription). If dorsal nerve block has been prescribed by MD, administer as per MD's written protocol prior to this step.

**Step 21.** Cleanse injection sites with chlorhexidine 0.5% or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Allow to fully dry.

**Step 22.** Attach 25G needle to PRP syringe.

**Step 23.** Injection sites (standard P-Shot protocol):
- **Corpus cavernosum (bilateral):** Insert at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, mid-shaft. Aspirate first — confirm no blood return before injecting. Inject 0.5–1.0 mL PRP per side in a slow retrograde fan pattern.
- **Glans penis:** Superficial injection into 2–4 sites around the glans. 0.1–0.2 mL per site. Intradermal/subdermal plane only.
- **Dorsal shaft:** Optional — inject 0.5 mL superficially along dorsal midline if tissue volume warrants.
- **Total PRP volume:** Typically 2–4 mL distributed across sites. Do not force if resistance encountered.

> **ASPIRATION RULE:** Always aspirate before injecting at each new needle position. If blood flashback is seen — reposition needle before injecting.

**Step 24.** Apply gentle pressure to each injection site with sterile gauze post-injection to minimise bruising. Do not massage.

**Step 25.** Apply a light non-adhesive dressing or leave open to air per patient comfort.

---

### POST-TREATMENT CHECKS (Mandatory Before Discharge)

**Step 26.** Observe patient in clinic for minimum **20 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Vasovagal response (pallor, sweating, bradycardia)
- Allergic / anaphylactic reaction (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension)
- Haematoma formation
- Signs of vascular compromise

**Step 27.** Complete post-treatment record in digital app — treatment delivered, energy settings, PRP volume, injection sites, patient response, any adverse events.

**Step 28.** Provide patient with printed Aftercare Protocol (Part 4).

**Step 29.** Book next LFSWT session (1–2 weeks). Schedule PRP follow-up injection (4–8 weeks if further injections are part of the plan).

**Step 30.** Record next appointment in digital system. Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up call/SMS via CRM.

## 1.7 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

> This protocol activates for ALL Grade 3+ adverse events (see definitions below) and any suspected anaphylaxis, vascular compromise, or serious haematoma.

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Minor: expected bruising, mild discomfort, transient redness | Document in app. Monitor. No escalation required. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: significant haematoma, prolonged pain >2 hours, unexpected swelling | Document in app. Telephone MD directly for guidance. Document MD advice. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: anaphylaxis, vascular compromise, priapism, suspected deep infection, loss of sensation | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION PROTOCOL BELOW** |

### Full Escalation Protocol — Severe Adverse Event

**Step E-1: Immediate Patient Safety**
Administer emergency first aid appropriate to the complication:
- **Anaphylaxis:** Administer adrenaline (epinephrine) 0.5 mg IM (anterolateral thigh) from clinic emergency kit. Call 999 immediately. Begin ABCDE assessment.
- **Priapism >4 hours:** Call 999. Do NOT attempt aspiration unless MD is present and directs.
- **Vascular compromise / severe haematoma:** Apply firm direct pressure. Call 999. Keep patient supine.
- **Always call 999 for any life-threatening emergency FIRST, before completing digital steps.**

**Step E-2: Digital Logging — Trigger Automated Escalation**
Practitioner logs the complication in the Menhancements digital app:
- Select: **"Adverse Event Report"**
- Enter: Patient ID, complication type, severity grade, time of onset, actions taken
- Submit the report

**Step E-3: Automated Webhook Activation**
App submission automatically fires a Webhook to the integration pipeline:

```
Digital App  →  Webhook  →  Zapier (workflow trigger)
                                    ↓
                        HubSpot: Contact flagged as "MEDICAL EMERGENCY — ACTIVE"
                        HubSpot: Timeline event created with Patient ID + complication type
                                    ↓
                        WhatsApp HQ Emergency Group: Automated alert message sent
                        [FORMAT: "⚠️ EMERGENCY ALERT | Patient ID: [XXXXX] |
                         Clinic: [LOCATION] | Complication: [TYPE] |
                         Time: [HH:MM] | Practitioner: [NAME] | 999 called: Y/N"]
                                    ↓
                        Manchester Medical Director: Notified via WhatsApp HQ Group
```

**Step E-4: MD Acknowledgement**
Manchester MD must acknowledge the WhatsApp alert within **5 minutes** during clinic hours, **15 minutes** out of hours. If no acknowledgement within this window — Practitioner telephones MD directly on the emergency line.

**Step E-5: Incident Documentation**
Within 24 hours of the event: complete full written incident report in the digital system. This auto-populates HubSpot timeline and generates a CQC-reportable event flag for the Clinical Governance lead to review.

**Step E-6: Post-Incident Review**
MD leads a structured case review within 72 hours. Findings documented. If CQC Statutory Notification required (e.g., unexpected death, serious injury) — Clinical Governance lead submits via CQC provider portal.

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Linear Focused Shockwave Therapy (LFSWT) + PRP P-Shot
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received clear, honest, and complete information about the treatment you are considering. You have the right to ask questions, take time to decide, and withdraw consent at any time before or during treatment without this affecting your care. Consent cannot be given on behalf of someone else.

---

## 3.2 What the Treatment Involves

**Linear Focused Shockwave Therapy (LFSWT)**
A handheld device delivers focused acoustic pressure waves to the penile shaft and surrounding vasculature. The mechanism is mechanical — no electrical current, no needles, no heat. Shockwaves stimulate new blood vessel growth and break down scar tissue. Multiple sessions are required (typically 6–12). You will feel a repetitive tapping pressure during treatment, which may be mildly uncomfortable.

**PRP P-Shot (Platelet-Rich Plasma Penile Injection)**
A sample of your own blood is drawn from your arm, placed in a centrifuge to concentrate the growth factors, and the resulting PRP is injected into specific sites in the penile shaft and glans using fine needles. A topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA — prescribed by our Medical Director) is applied 60 minutes before injection to minimise discomfort. A nerve block injection may also be used.

---

## 3.3 What Results Are Realistic

**Important: results are not guaranteed.** Evidence from clinical trials suggests the following outcomes are *possible*, not certain:

- Improvement in erectile hardness and duration in 60–75% of patients (variable depending on ED aetiology)
- Partial or complete reduction in Peyronie's plaque (LFSWT)
- Reduced reliance on PDE5 inhibitors in responders
- Results typically begin to appear 6–12 weeks post-treatment; full effect at 3–6 months
- Duration of effect: 12–24 months on average; maintenance sessions may be required
- Non-responders do exist — particularly in severe neurogenic ED or end-stage vascular disease

You have not been promised a specific outcome. Any guarantee of outcome would be a misrepresentation.

---

## 3.4 Risks and Potential Complications

**Common (expected and temporary):**
- Superficial redness, bruising, or petechiae at shockwave sites (resolves within 48–72 hours)
- Mild swelling at PRP injection sites (resolves within 24–72 hours)
- Transient discomfort or sensitivity post-procedure
- Minor bruising at venepuncture site (arm)
- Temporary mild aching (1–2 days)

**Uncommon (occur in a minority of patients):**
- Significant haematoma at injection site
- Prolonged swelling >72 hours
- Skin pigmentation change at treatment zone
- Temporary reduced sensitivity (usually resolves within days to weeks)

**Rare but serious:**
- Infection at injection site (requiring antibiotics or drainage)
- Allergic reaction to anaesthetic agents — anaphylaxis (medical emergency; we carry adrenaline)
- Priapism (persistent erection >4 hours) — medical emergency; call 999 immediately
- Vascular injury
- Nerve injury

**Unknown long-term risks:**
This combination treatment protocol does not have a 20+ year evidence base. Long-term outcomes beyond 3–5 years have not been systematically studied. You accept this uncertainty.

---

## 3.5 Alternatives to This Treatment

You have been made aware of the following alternatives:
- PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) — first-line pharmacotherapy
- Vacuum erection devices
- Penile implant surgery (for refractory ED)
- Testosterone replacement therapy (if testosterone deficient)
- Psychological/psychosexual therapy (where indicated)
- No treatment / watchful waiting

## 4.1 What to Expect in the First 72 Hours

This is normal and expected:
- Mild to moderate swelling of the penile shaft and/or glans — peaks at 24–48 hours, subsides by 72 hours
- Superficial bruising or small blood spots (petechiae) at shockwave sites
- Bruising at the venepuncture site on your arm
- Mild tenderness or sensitivity when touched — this is expected
- The penile shaft may appear slightly firmer or fuller initially — this is a normal inflammatory healing response

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — Follow These Exactly

**Sexual Activity:**
- **No sexual activity (penetrative or masturbation) for 48 hours post-treatment.** After 48 hours, gentle activity is acceptable. Avoid aggressive or prolonged activity for 7 days.

**Medication:**
- **Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses) for 5 days post-PRP.** NSAIDs reduce platelet activity and can significantly reduce PRP efficacy. Use paracetamol for pain relief only.
- Continue any prescribed medications unless your MD has specifically advised otherwise.

**Hygiene:**
- Keep the area clean and dry for 24 hours. After 24 hours, normal showering is fine.
- No swimming, hot tubs, or saunas for 72 hours.

**Compression / Pressure:**
- Avoid tight underwear or cycling for 48 hours. Loose-fitting boxers are recommended.

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for 24 hours post-treatment (can increase bruising and impair healing response).

**Exercise:**
- Light activity is fine from the next day. Avoid intense cardiovascular exercise or cycling for 72 hours.

**Smoking:**
- If you smoke — do not smoke for at least 48 hours post-treatment. Smoking significantly impairs the neovascularisation mechanism that LFSWT depends on.

## 4.3 Optimising Your Results

- Complete the full LFSWT course. Single sessions do not produce lasting results — the biological benefit is cumulative.
- Maintain cardiovascular fitness. The shockwave mechanism drives angiogenesis — a strong cardiovascular system amplifies this.
- Optimise testosterone if low — speak to your Practitioner about testing if not already done.
- Maintain good sleep hygiene — testosterone peaks during deep sleep.
- Avoid PDE5 inhibitors for 48 hours post-treatment (they may interfere with the natural vascular response the treatment is designed to build).
- You will be contacted at 48 hours by our team for a follow-up check.

## 4.4 Emergency Red Flags — Seek Immediate Medical Attention (999 / A&E)

**Go to A&E or call 999 immediately if you experience any of the following:**

🔴 **Persistent erection lasting more than 2 hours** — this is priapism, a medical emergency. Do not wait. Go to A&E immediately. Tell them you have had a penile injection.

🔴 **Difficulty breathing, throat swelling, rash, or dizziness** — signs of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Call 999.

🔴 **Rapidly increasing swelling, spreading redness, or severe pain beyond 24 hours** — may indicate infection or haematoma requiring urgent assessment.

🔴 **Complete loss of sensation to the penis** — requires urgent medical review.

🔴 **Fever >38°C within 72 hours of treatment** — seek urgent GP or A&E assessment.
