# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Botulinum Toxin Type A — Aesthetic & Hyperhidrosis Treatment
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-007 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNT-A) for aesthetic facial treatment and axillary hyperhidrosis at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan.

**Aesthetic indications covered:** Forehead lines (frontalis), glabellar frown lines, lateral canthal lines (crow's feet), brow lift, bunny lines, lip flip, chin dimpling (mentalis), platysmal bands (neck), and masseter hypertrophy / jaw slimming.

**Functional indication covered:** Axillary hyperhidrosis (primary focal hyperhidrosis of the axillae).

**This treatment uses a Prescription-Only Medicine.** Botulinum Toxin Type A is classified as a POM under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. Under the Health and Care Act 2022 (England), non-surgical cosmetic procedures using BoNT-A must be performed by, or under the oversight of, a registered healthcare professional. The Manchester Medical Director (MD) is the **sole prescriber** of all Botulinum Toxin products at all Menhancements clinic locations. The treating Practitioner administers the treatment; the MD prescribes but does not administer.

**Male-specific clinical context:** Men present with fundamentally different aesthetic anatomy and goals to female patients. Male frontalis and masseter muscles are larger and require higher doses. Male brow position is horizontal and lower — over-treatment of the upper forehead produces brow ptosis or unwanted feminising arch. Male aesthetic goals typically centre on appearing less fatigued, more authoritative, and better-defined — not softened. All injection plans must be calibrated to masculine facial anatomy.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — BOTULINUM TOXIN IS A PRESCRIPTION-ONLY MEDICINE**
> A valid, patient-specific MD prescription must be present on the digital record before any BoNT-A product is opened, reconstituted, or drawn up. No exceptions. The prescription must specify: product name, total units, treatment area(s), dilution protocol, and date. The Practitioner verifies the prescription at every session before proceeding.

> **NOTICE 2 — UNIT EQUIVALENCY IS NOT 1:1 BETWEEN PRODUCTS**
> Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) units are NOT equivalent to Azzalure/Dysport (AbobotulinumtoxinA) units. Azzalure units are approximately 2.5× Botox units for the same clinical effect. Bocouture/Xeomin (IncobotulinumtoxinA) is approximately dose-equivalent to Botox. The MD prescribes a specific product and dose in the units of that product. The Practitioner must never substitute a different product without a new MD prescription.

> **NOTICE 3 — UPPER EYELID PTOSIS RISK (GLABELLAR ZONE)**
> Glabellar injection carries a risk of BoNT-A spread to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, causing upper eyelid ptosis. This is the most clinically significant aesthetic complication of facial BoNT-A. Strict injection placement rules and dose limits for the glabellar zone are mandatory. See Section 1.8 — Phase 2.

> **NOTICE 4 — MALE BROW ANATOMY — DO NOT FEMINISE**
> The male brow sits at or below the supraorbital rim. Over-treatment of the medial frontalis or inadequate treatment of brow depressors produces either brow ptosis (brow drops) or an arched, feminised brow. Male BoNT-A facial treatment requires specific injection mapping that differs from female protocols. Female injection templates must not be applied to male patients.

> **NOTICE 5 — OFF-LABEL USE — MULTIPLE AREAS**
> BoNT-A is licensed for glabellar frown lines and crow's feet. All other aesthetic facial uses (forehead, brow lift, bunny lines, lip flip, chin, platysma, masseter) and axillary hyperhidrosis are off-label for some products or represent use beyond the licensed indication. Off-label use must be disclosed at consent.

## 1.2 Licensed Products & Unit Equivalencies

> The MD prescribes a specific named product and specific units. The Practitioner does not substitute products or adjust units independently.

| Product | Manufacturer | Type | Unit Equivalency to Botox | Typical Vial Sizes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Botox** | Allergan / AbbVie | OnabotulinumtoxinA | Reference (1:1) | 50 IU, 100 IU |
| **Bocouture** | Merz | IncobotulinumtoxinA | ~1:1 with Botox | 50 IU, 100 IU |
| **Xeomin** | Merz | IncobotulinumtoxinA | ~1:1 with Botox | 50 IU, 100 IU |
| **Azzalure** | Galderma | AbobotulinumtoxinA | ~2.5 Azzalure units = 1 Botox unit | 125 IU |
| **Dysport** | Ipsen | AbobotulinumtoxinA | ~2.5–3 Dysport units = 1 Botox unit | 300 IU, 500 IU |

> **WARNING:** Never convert doses between products independently. If the clinic stocks a different product than prescribed, contact the MD for a new prescription — do not substitute and adjust.

### Reconstitution Reference (Botox / Bocouture / Xeomin — OnabotulinumtoxinA / IncobotulinumtoxinA)

| Saline Added to 100 IU Vial | Concentration | Volume per 10 IU |
|---|---|---|

## 1.3 Treatment Zones, Indications & Male Dose Reference

> All doses below are expressed in **Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) units**. Convert as per Section 1.2 if using a different product. Male doses are at the higher end of ranges owing to larger muscle mass. The MD specifies the exact dose per zone on the prescription.

### Aesthetic Facial Zones

| Zone | Target Muscle(s) | Male Dose Range (Botox IU) | Licensed? | Key Anatomical Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Forehead lines** | Frontalis | 10–25 IU | Off-label | Brow ptosis if over-treated or too low. NEVER treat forehead without also treating brow depressors in same session (or planning to). |
| **Glabellar frown lines** | Procerus, corrugator supercilii (bilateral) | 20–35 IU | Licensed (Botox, Azzalure, Bocouture) | Upper eyelid ptosis (spread to levator palpebrae via orbital septum). Strict injection placement rules mandatory. |
| **Lateral canthal lines (crow's feet)** | Orbicularis oculi (lateral) | 10–18 IU per side | Licensed (Botox, Azzalure) | Lower eyelid ectropion if injected too close to lid margin or too deeply |
| **Brow lift** | Orbicularis oculi (lateral brow depressor) | 2–5 IU per side | Off-label | Over-lateral placement causes Spock/arched brow |
| **Bunny lines** | Nasalis | 4–8 IU | Off-label | Lip ptosis / oral incompetence if too low |
| **Lip flip** | Orbicularis oris (upper lip, central) | 2–4 IU | Off-label | Oral incompetence (difficulty using straws, drinking from bottles, playing wind instruments) if over-dosed. LOW doses only. |
| **Chin dimpling** | Mentalis | 4–8 IU | Off-label | Lip asymmetry if asymmetric placement |
| **Platysmal bands (neck)** | Platysma | 20–40 IU total | Off-label | Dysphagia if spread to strap muscles or larynx; swallowing difficulty |
| **Masseter (jaw slimming)** | Masseter (bilateral) | 20–40 IU per side | Off-label | Smile asymmetry (spread to zygomaticus/risorius); parotid gland inadvertent injection; chewing weakness |

### Hyperhidrosis Zone

| Zone | Target | Dose (Botox IU) | Licensed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Axillary hyperhidrosis** | Eccrine sweat glands (intradermal) | 50 IU per axilla (100 IU total) | Licensed (Botox) | Starch-iodine test to map active sweat zones. Inject intradermally. |

---

## 1.4 Male-Specific Aesthetic Considerations

> These rules apply to all male facial BoNT-A treatment. Practitioners must read this section before treating any male patient.

**Brow position:**
The male brow sits AT or below the supraorbital rim (flat, horizontal brow). Any treatment that elevates the medial or central brow produces an arched, feminised appearance. Male forehead treatment is injected higher than female treatment — typically 3–4 cm above the orbital rim. The lower forehead (within 3 cm of the orbital rim) is left untreated unless treating specific deep lines, and only in low doses.

**Frontalis dose and pattern:**
Male frontalis is larger and thicker — requires higher doses than female equivalents. However, conservative treatment is still preferable at first session. An underdosed, natural result is preferred over an over-treated, expressionless forehead. Standard male pattern: 4–6 injection points across the upper third of the forehead, avoiding the lower third entirely.

**Glabellar treatment:**
Frown lines are common in men and are often the primary concern. Males typically require higher glabellar doses (25–35 IU Botox) than females. The procerus is proportionally larger in men.

**Masseter treatment:**
Masseter slimming is a common and appropriate male treatment — reducing jaw width and improving facial proportion. It does NOT feminise the face in most male presentations. However, the masseter injection zone must be precisely within the lower-posterior mass of the muscle — superior injection risks smile asymmetry by spreading to the zygomaticus. The anterosuperior masseter overlies risorius/zygomaticus and must be avoided.

**Crow's feet:**
Male skin is thicker — lateral canthal lines tend to be deeper than in female patients. Higher doses and/or a slightly more medial placement may be appropriate. Do not underdose crow's feet in men.

**Platysmal bands:**
Increasingly popular in male patients for a more defined neck profile. Requires careful dosing — dysphagia is a real risk with high volumes. Maximum total dose guidance should be followed strictly.

## 1.5 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Neuromuscular junction disorder (myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, motor neurone disease) | BoNT-A potentiates neuromuscular blockade — risk of generalised weakness and respiratory compromise |
| Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) — current use | Potentiates BoNT-A neuromuscular effect — unpredictable dose response |
| Lincosamide antibiotics (clindamycin, lincomycin) — current use | Potentiates BoNT-A — same mechanism |
| Active infection, inflammation, or open wound at the injection site | Contraindicated per product SPC |
| Known hypersensitivity to Botulinum Toxin Type A or any product component (human albumin, lactose, sucrose — varies by product) | Anaphylaxis risk |
| Patient under 18 years of age | Not licensed or appropriate |
| Patient lacking capacity to consent | Legally prohibited |
| No valid MD prescription on patient digital record | Clinical governance absolute stop |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Peripheral neuropathy (any cause) | BoNT-A response may be exaggerated or unpredictable; MD review |
| Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy | Increased bruising risk particularly at crow's feet and glabellar zones; MD to advise cessation or document risk |
| Swallowing difficulties or respiratory muscle weakness | Any systemic BoNT-A spread risk is elevated; MD assessment mandatory; platysmal treatment should not proceed |
| Concurrent neuromuscular-affecting medications (magnesium, quinine, spectinomycin at therapeutic doses) | Drug interaction risk; MD review |
| Significant asymmetry of facial musculature at baseline | Document precisely and photograph; patient must acknowledge pre-existing asymmetry before treatment |
| History of previous BoNT-A adverse reaction at any site | Document fully; transmit to MD; prior product and reaction type must inform new prescription |
| Known history of antibody formation to BoNT-A (secondary non-response) | MD to consider switching product type |
| Keloidal or hypertrophic scarring in the treatment zone | Risk of abnormal healing response to injection trauma |
| Active cold sore (HSV-1) at or near treatment site | Defer until fully resolved — needle trauma can precipitate HSV reactivation |
| Significant anxiety or needle phobia | Manage pre-procedure; anxiolytic options per MD if needed |
| Pregnancy or breastfeeding (partner not applicable — patient only) | N/A for male patients — document |

## 1.7 Prescribing & Consultation Pathway

### THE MANCHESTER MD IS THE SOLE PRESCRIBER FOR ALL BOTULINUM TOXIN AT MENHANCEMENTS

---

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 20–30 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Assesses presenting concerns and treatment goals — documented in the patient's own words
2. Conducts full static and dynamic facial assessment: at rest; on maximum expression (raising eyebrows, frowning, smiling, squinting, lip pursing — per zones of interest)
3. Assesses and documents baseline facial asymmetry — pre-existing asymmetry must be photographed and disclosed to the patient before treatment
4. Photographs standardised set: neutral repose, full expression, close-up of zones proposed for treatment
5. Assesses brow position (male — horizontal/flat; confirms treatment will not elevate medial brow)
6. Completes full medical history and contraindication screen (neuromuscular disorders and aminoglycoside use are the critical absolute contraindications to cover)
7. For axillary hyperhidrosis: assesses severity, impact on quality of life; performs or arranges starch-iodine test to map active sweat zones
8. **Does NOT prescribe BoNT-A or any POM**
9. **Does NOT open, reconstitute, or draw up any product**
10. Completes MD Referral Trigger Checklist and transmits to MD

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation (standard for Leeds/Wilmslow/Wigan) OR in-person (Manchester)
**Mandatory for:** ALL new BoNT-A patients; first treatment session in any new zone; any patient with a relative contraindication

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner assessment and baseline photographs
2. Reviews contraindication screen — clears neuromuscular disorders, drug interactions
3. Reviews treatment zones requested and confirms suitability
4. Reviews male brow anatomy from photographs — confirms injection plan will not feminise brow or cause ptosis
5. Discloses off-label status for any zone outside the licensed glabellar/crow's feet indications
6. Determines product, total units per zone, dilution protocol, and injection map guidance
7. Issues written POM prescription — documented in patient digital record:
   - Patient name and date of birth
   - Product name (brand and generic)
   - Total units per treatment zone (itemised)
   - Dilution (volume of saline per vial)
   - Date of prescription and MD signature with GMC number
8. Issues 2-week review appointment
9. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

> **For established patients with no new contraindications, no new zones, and a standard repeat prescription:** the MD may issue a standing repeat prescription valid for one treatment episode. The Practitioner must confirm at Stage 3 that no new contraindications have arisen and that the repeat prescription is current.

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Prescription Verification (Mandatory Every Session)

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] MD prescription present, dated, and signed — product, units per zone, dilution confirmed
- [ ] Product in hand matches prescription exactly (brand name and formulation)
- [ ] Product batch number and expiry confirmed — recorded in digital system
- [ ] No new contraindications — verbal screen: new medications (especially aminoglycosides), new diagnoses, new neurological symptoms
- [ ] Baseline photographs on file
- [ ] Today's pre-treatment photographs taken
- [ ] Signed Informed Consent on file

**If any item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Contact MD before proceeding.**

---

## 1.8 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT

**P-1.** Confirm patient identity and complete Stage 3 checklist.

**P-2.** Take today's standardised pre-treatment photographs: neutral repose (full face, frontal), full animation per treatment zones, close-up of each proposed zone. Store in digital record.

**P-3.** Room preparation: patient in treatment chair or bed, reclined to 45°. Good directional lighting — ideally directional overhead and side lighting to reveal surface lines. Mirror available for patient to point to areas of concern.

**P-4.** For male patients — verbally confirm brow aesthetic goal: "We are aiming to maintain your natural, horizontal brow position and address [specific concerns]. We are not looking to raise or arch the brow." Document patient confirms this understanding.

---

### PHASE 1 — RECONSTITUTION

**Step 1.** Confirm product batch number and expiry. Record in digital system.

**Step 2.** Draw up the MD-prescribed volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection into a syringe using a drawing-up needle.

**Step 3.** Inject saline gently into the BoNT-A vial — angle needle to allow saline to run down the side of the vial rather than directly onto the product cake. Do not inject with force. Do not shake — rotate gently 8–10 times until fully dissolved.

**Step 4.** Inspect reconstituted solution — must be clear and colourless. Do not use if cloudy, discoloured, or contains particulate matter.

**Step 5.** Draw up into 1 mL syringe(s) per treatment zone. Attach 30G or 32G injection needle. Label each syringe with patient initials, zone, IU/0.1 mL concentration, and time of reconstitution.

---

### PHASE 2 — ZONE-BY-ZONE INJECTION PROTOCOLS

> Read the specific protocol for each zone being treated. Follow dose limits and anatomical rules precisely. These are not preferences — they are patient safety parameters.

---

#### ZONE A — GLABELLAR FROWN LINES (Procerus + Corrugator Supercilii)

**Anatomy:** Procerus (vertical lines at nasal bridge — draws brow medially and inferiorly). Corrugator supercilii (horizontal glabellar lines — draws brow medially). Both lie deep to the frontalis in the glabellar region.

**Ptosis risk — MANDATORY RULE:** Upper eyelid ptosis occurs when BoNT-A diffuses inferiorly through the orbital septum to the levator palpebrae superioris. To prevent this:
- **Never inject within 1 cm of the supraorbital rim**
- **Never inject medially past the mid-pupillary line** for corrugator injections
- **Keep volumes per point low (0.05–0.1 mL maximum)** at the most inferior injection points
- **Press firmly on the injection site** with gauze for 30 seconds after inferior glabellar points — this limits inferolateral diffusion

**Standard injection map (Botox IU — male):**
- Procerus: 1 point, midline, at the level of the nasal bridge or 0.5 cm superior — **5–8 IU**
- Corrugator bilateral: 2 points per side (head and body of corrugator) — **8–12 IU per side**
- Total typical male dose: **25–35 IU Botox** (adjust per MD prescription)

**Injection:** Insert needle at 45° bevel-up into the muscle belly. Aspirate. Inject. Withdraw. Apply gentle pressure for 30 seconds. Do NOT massage.

---

#### ZONE B — FOREHEAD LINES (Frontalis)

**Anatomy:** Frontalis is the ONLY brow elevator. Over-treatment or treatment too close to the brow causes brow ptosis.

**Male-specific rules:**
- **Minimum safe distance from brow: 3–4 cm** (vs. 2–3 cm in female patients — male brow is lower)
- Inject only in the upper third of the forehead
- Use a distributed pattern of 4–6 points to avoid central sparing (central brow drop with lateral brow rise = Spock brow)
- Do NOT treat forehead as a standalone zone in a first-time patient without simultaneous glabellar treatment — isolated forehead treatment removes brow elevation while leaving depressors untreated, causing brow descent

**Standard injection map (Botox IU — male):**
- 4–6 points distributed across upper forehead, minimum 3.5 cm above brow
- **2–4 IU per point; total 10–25 IU** (start conservatively; top-up at 2 weeks is preferable to over-treatment)

**Injection:** Superficial intramuscular or deep subdermal. Do not inject too deeply (subcutaneous injection gives less reliable results and increases bruising).

---

#### ZONE C — LATERAL CANTHAL LINES (Crow's Feet — Orbicularis Oculi)

**Anatomy:** Lateral orbital fibres of orbicularis oculi. Lies superficially lateral to the orbital rim.

**Safety rules:**
- **Never inject within 1 cm of the lower eyelid margin** — risk of lower eyelid weakness, ectropion, and dry eye
- **Never inject medially to the lateral orbital rim** — risk of orbital spread
- Stay lateral — injection points should be at least 1 cm lateral to the bony orbital rim
- Do not inject deeply — orbicularis is superficial; deep injection risks periosteal bruising and orbital spread

**Standard injection map (Botox IU — male, per side):**
- 3–4 points distributed in a fan pattern lateral to the orbital rim
- Spacing: approximately 1 cm between each point
- **3–5 IU per point; total 10–18 IU per side**

---

#### ZONE D — BROW LIFT (Lateral Brow Depressor — Orbicularis Oculi)

**Anatomy:** The lateral fibres of orbicularis oculi depress the lateral brow. Treating this selectively allows the lateral frontalis (unopposed) to elevate the lateral brow slightly.

**Male note:** Brow lift is appropriate in men but should produce a subtle lateral elevation — not an arch. Keep doses minimal.

**Standard injection map:**
- 1 point per side, directly above the tail of the brow, subcutaneous
- **2–3 IU per side**

---

#### ZONE E — BUNNY LINES (Nasalis)

**Anatomy:** Transverse lines across the nasal dorsum on animation. Nasalis muscle.

**Safety rule:** Do not inject too inferiorly — risk of affecting the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (causes lip ptosis).

**Standard injection map:**
- 1–2 points per side on the nasal dorsum, at least 1 cm above the alar crease
- **2–4 IU per side**

---

#### ZONE F — LIP FLIP (Orbicularis Oris — Superior)

**Anatomy:** Superficial injection into the superior orbicularis oris causes slight eversion (flip) of the upper lip vermillion. Does not add volume — purely postural change.

**CRITICAL LOW-DOSE ZONE:**
- **Total dose must not exceed 4 IU Botox (usually 2–4 IU total)**
- Over-injection causes oral incompetence: difficulty drinking from bottles, using straws, whistling, kissing, playing wind instruments
- Patients must be counselled that oral function may be transiently affected even at therapeutic doses
- This zone is NOT appropriate for patients who play wind instruments, are singers, or whose profession requires precise lip control

**Standard injection map:**
- 2–3 points along the Cupid's bow/vermillion border of the upper lip
- **0.5–1 IU per point; total 2–4 IU maximum**

---

#### ZONE G — CHIN DIMPLING (Mentalis)

**Anatomy:** Mentalis muscle produces chin dimpling / peau d'orange on contraction.

**Standard injection map:**
- 1–2 central points in the mid-chin
- **4–8 IU total**

**Safety:** Bilateral symmetrical injection essential. Unilateral injection causes visible lip asymmetry.

---

#### ZONE H — PLATYSMAL BANDS (Neck — Platysma)

**HIGHER RISK ZONE — MD REVIEW REQUIRED FOR FIRST-TIME TREATMENT**

**Anatomy:** Platysma is a broad, thin muscle of the anterior neck. Prominent vertical bands are visible at rest or on animation.

**Critical safety rules:**
- **Total dose must not exceed 40 IU per session** (dysphagia risk if strap muscles or laryngeal muscles are affected by spread)
- Inject directly into the visible band — do NOT inject lateral to the visible band (risk of spread to sternocleidomastoid)
- Multiple small injections along the length of each band (0.5–1 cm apart)
- **Never inject deep to the platysma** — swallowing musculature lies immediately beneath
- **Patient must be upright or at 30°** during injection — not fully reclined

**Standard injection map:**
- Identify each visible platysmal band on animation (patient tenses neck)
- 4–6 injection points per visible band, spaced 1 cm apart along the band length
- **2–5 IU per point; 10–20 IU per band; total maximum 40 IU**

**Contraindication: Do not treat platysma in any patient with prior dysphagia, swallowing difficulties, or any condition affecting strap muscles.**

---

#### ZONE I — MASSETER HYPERTROPHY / JAW SLIMMING (Masseter)

**Anatomy:** The masseter is a powerful jaw muscle originating from the zygomatic arch and inserting into the mandibular angle and ramus. The lower-posterior mass is the correct injection zone.

**Critical injection boundary rules:**
- **Identify and mark the anterior border of the masseter on clenching** — never inject anterior to this line (zygomaticus / risorius lie anteriorly — injection here causes smile asymmetry)
- **Identify and mark the lower border of the zygoma** — never inject within 1 cm superiorly of this line (parotid gland and zygomatic branch of facial nerve lie superiorly)
- Correct injection zone: inferior-posterior quadrant of the masseter, confirmed by asking patient to clench — feel the firm muscle bulk; inject into this bulk at the mandibular angle area

**Standard injection map (per side):**
- 2–3 points in the inferior-posterior masseter mass
- **10–20 IU per point; 20–40 IU per side** (start at lower end — top-up at 2 weeks preferable)
- Allow 4–5 months minimum before full re-assessment of jaw slimming results (muscle atrophy is progressive)

**Post-injection:** Instruct patient to clench and unclench the jaw 20 times immediately post-injection to distribute the product within the muscle.

---

#### ZONE J — AXILLARY HYPERHIDROSIS (Eccrine Sweat Glands)

**Assessment — Starch-Iodine Test (Minor's Test):**
1. Dry the axillary skin completely
2. Apply aqueous iodine solution to the entire axillary vault and allow to dry (approximately 2 minutes)
3. Apply corn or rice starch powder over the dried iodine
4. Areas of active sweating turn dark blue-black — map these zones precisely
5. Photograph the positive zone map for the clinical record

**Anaesthetic:** For axillary hyperhidrosis, EMLA cream applied 45–60 minutes prior to injection is recommended given the higher injection point count and potentially sensitive axillary skin. **EMLA is a POM — MD prescription required.** Add to MD prescriptions for this zone.

**Standard injection map:**
- Mark a grid across the positively staining zone — 1–1.5 cm spacing between injection points
- Typical injection points: 15–20 per axilla
- **Injection:** Intradermal (2–3 mm depth, bevel-up, 30G or 32G needle) — a small bleb should form confirming intradermal placement. **Do NOT inject subcutaneously — intradermal placement is essential for sweat gland targeting.**
- **2.5–3 IU per point (at standard 4 mL/100 IU dilution); 50 IU per axilla; 100 IU total for bilateral treatment**

---

### POST-INJECTION (ALL ZONES — MANDATORY)

**Step 6.** After all planned zones are injected: apply cold pack (wrapped in cloth — no direct skin contact) to all injection sites for 2–3 minutes to reduce bruising and swelling.

**Step 7.** Do NOT massage any injection site — this distributes BoNT-A to unintended muscles.

**Step 8.** Observe patient for minimum **20 minutes**. Monitor for:
- Vasovagal response
- Allergic / anaphylactic reaction (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm)
- Any immediate unexpected neurological symptom

**Step 9.** Complete digital record: product, batch, units per zone, dilution, injection points per zone, patient response, any adverse events.

**Step 10.** Book 2-week review. Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up contact via CRM.

**Step 11.** Issue Aftercare Protocol (Part 4). Verbally review key restrictions (4-hour upright rule, exercise restriction, no massage) before patient leaves.

---

## 1.9 Two-Week Review & Top-Up Protocol

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner
**Purpose:** Assess response; identify asymmetry; administer top-up units if needed under the same MD prescription episode

**At 2-week review:**
1. Take post-treatment photographs — identical positioning to baseline set
2. Assess each treated zone: effect achieved, symmetry, patient satisfaction
3. Identify areas of under-treatment, inadequate effect, or asymmetry
4. If top-up is needed — confirm it is within the MD prescription's authorised total units and administer
5. If additional units beyond the prescription are needed — contact MD for an updated prescription before administering
6. Document review outcome in digital record

## 1.10 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Expected: bruising, mild swelling, transient headache, minor tenderness | Document in app. Advise patient. No escalation. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: visible asymmetry, eyelid heaviness (early ptosis), persistent headache >24 hours, mild swallowing discomfort post-platysmal treatment, smile asymmetry post-masseter | Document in app. Contact MD directly. Record guidance. 2-week review may be moved forward. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: confirmed upper eyelid ptosis with functional visual impairment, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), generalised weakness, respiratory difficulty, anaphylaxis | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION PROTOCOL + CALL 999 if respiratory/systemic** |

### Eyelid Ptosis — Specific Management

**Grade 2 (early brow heaviness / eyelid heaviness without functional impairment):**
- Document onset and degree precisely
- Photograph
- Contact MD — MD may prescribe apraclonidine 0.5% eye drops (alpha-agonist — stimulates Müller's muscle, which provides partial lid elevation). **Apraclonidine is a POM — new MD prescription required.**
- Advise patient: ptosis typically resolves within 2–6 weeks as BoNT-A effect wanes; rarely persists beyond 8–12 weeks

**Grade 3 (functional visual impairment from ptosis):**
- Activate full escalation protocol
- Contact MD emergency line directly
- Refer to ophthalmology urgently for assessment

### Full Escalation Protocol

**Step E-1:** Manage immediate patient safety (anaphylaxis: IM adrenaline + 999; dysphagia/respiratory: 999; ptosis: ophthalmology referral via MD)

**Step E-2: Digital Logging**

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Botulinum Toxin Type A — Aesthetic & Hyperhidrosis
**Product prescribed:** _____________________________ **Zones:** _____________________________
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete, honest information about your BoNT-A treatment before agreeing to proceed. Take time to read it. Ask questions. You may withdraw consent at any time before the first injection.

---

## 3.2 What the Treatment Involves

Botulinum Toxin Type A is a purified protein that temporarily blocks nerve signals to muscles, causing targeted relaxation. For aesthetic treatment, this smooths lines created by muscle contraction. For axillary hyperhidrosis, it blocks the nerve signals to sweat glands, reducing sweating.

The treatment is delivered by injection using a very fine needle directly into the targeted muscle or skin. The procedure takes approximately 15–30 minutes depending on the number of zones treated.

---

## 3.3 Prescription-Only Medicine

Botulinum Toxin is a Prescription-Only Medicine. It has been prescribed for you specifically by the Menhancements Manchester Medical Director following a clinical assessment. The Medical Director does not administer the injection; your treating Practitioner does.

---

## 3.4 Off-Label Use Disclosure

The following zones being treated today are uses beyond or outside the licensed indication for some BoNT-A products in the UK (tick all that apply):

☐ Forehead lines — off-label for some products
☐ Brow lift — off-label
☐ Bunny lines — off-label
☐ Lip flip — off-label
☐ Chin dimpling — off-label
☐ Platysmal bands (neck) — off-label
☐ Masseter slimming — off-label
☐ Glabellar lines — licensed ☐ Crow's feet — licensed ☐ Axillary hyperhidrosis — licensed (Botox)

Off-label prescribing by a qualified doctor is lawful in the UK when the prescriber has assessed it as clinically appropriate. The Manchester MD has done so in your case.

---

## 3.5 Realistic Outcomes

Botulinum Toxin relaxes muscles. It does not remove lines already present at rest — it reduces lines caused by muscle movement. For deep lines at rest, results will be partial and may improve with repeated treatments over time as the muscle weakens progressively.

Onset: 2–5 days. Full effect: 10–14 days. Duration: 3–4 months (facial); 4–7 months (axillary hyperhidrosis). Repeat treatment is required to maintain results.

No specific outcome is guaranteed.

---

## 3.6 Risks and Potential Complications

**Common (expected and temporary):**
- Redness and mild swelling at injection points — resolves within hours
- Bruising — resolves within 7–14 days; more likely at crow's feet and glabellar zones
- Mild headache post-treatment — usually resolves within 24 hours
- Mild tenderness

**Uncommon:**
- Asymmetry of treatment effect — one side may show more relaxation than the other; typically addressable at 2-week review
- Brow heaviness or slight brow drop — if frontalis is over-treated; temporary; resolves as product wears off (2–4 months)
- Temporary altered sensation at injection points

**Rare but clinically significant:**
- **Upper eyelid ptosis (drooping eyelid)** — from glabellar treatment, if the toxin spreads to the levator palpebrae muscle. Typically temporary (2–8 weeks). Protocol is in place to minimise this risk. Apraclonidine eye drops may be prescribed by the MD to manage it while it resolves.
- **Smile asymmetry or lip weakness** — from masseter or lip injection zone involvement; temporary
- **Oral incompetence** — from lip flip (difficulty using a straw or drinking from a bottle); temporary; requires low-dose protocol — in place
- **Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)** — rare; from platysmal band treatment if BoNT-A spreads to swallowing musculature. This is a medical emergency if severe. Call 999.
- **Generalised weakness or respiratory difficulty** — very rare systemic BoNT-A effect; medical emergency; call 999.
- **Allergic reaction / anaphylaxis** — rare; emergency equipment is in the clinic

**Date of treatment:** _____________
**Clinic:** _____________ **Practitioner:** _____________
**2-week review appointment:** _____________

## 4.1 What to Expect

**In the first 24 hours:**
- Small red marks at injection points — resolve within hours
- Minor swelling at injection sites — resolve within hours
- Possible mild bruising — particularly at glabellar and crow's feet; peaks at 24–48 hours; resolves within 7–14 days
- Mild headache — common post-glabellar treatment; managed with paracetamol

**Days 2–5:**
- First effects begin to appear — subtle reduction in muscle movement
- This is not the final result

**Day 10–14:**
- Full effect visible — this is when your 2-week review is scheduled and the result is properly assessed

**Duration:**
- Aesthetic facial treatment: typically 3–4 months
- Axillary hyperhidrosis: typically 4–7 months

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — First 4 Hours

**Stay upright:**
- Remain upright (seated or standing) for **4 hours** after injection
- Do not lie flat, bend forward significantly, or apply pressure to the treated areas for 4 hours
- This prevents BoNT-A from migrating to unintended muscles (e.g., from the glabellar zone into the levator palpebrae)

**Do not massage or rub:**
- Do NOT touch, press, or massage any injection site for **24 hours**
- Massage distributes the toxin to adjacent unintended muscles

**Exercise:**
- Avoid vigorous exercise for **24 hours** post-treatment
- Light facial expressions and gentle movement of the treated muscles in the first hour (e.g., frowning and raising brows repeatedly) may help localise the product — your Practitioner will advise

---

## 4.3 Instructions for the First 24 Hours

**Heat:**
- Avoid saunas, hot yoga, steam rooms, or prolonged sun exposure for **24 hours** — heat increases local blood flow and may increase BoNT-A spread

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for **24 hours** — increases bruising risk

**Skincare:**
- Avoid retinols, acids, exfoliants, or active skincare at injection sites for **24 hours**
- Gentle cleansing is fine after 6 hours
- Makeup may be applied after 6 hours — use light patting application, not rubbing

**Flying:**
- Avoid long-haul flights (>4 hours) for **24 hours** post-treatment

---

## 4.4 Axillary Hyperhidrosis — Additional Instructions

- Avoid applying antiperspirant or deodorant to the treated axillae for **24 hours**
- Avoid shaving the axillae for **48 hours**
- Effect typically begins within 1–2 weeks; full effect at 2–4 weeks
- Repeat treatment is needed approximately every 4–7 months to maintain effect

---

## 4.5 Emergency Red Flags — Act Immediately

🔴 **Difficulty swallowing, speaking, or breathing** — possible BoNT-A spread to swallowing or respiratory musculature. Call 999 immediately. Tell them you have received Botulinum Toxin injection.

🔴 **Generalised muscle weakness, drooping of both eyelids, or double vision** — possible systemic BoNT-A effect. Call 999.

🔴 **Rash, throat tightening, difficulty breathing, or collapse** — anaphylaxis. Call 999.

🔴 **Significant drooping of ONE eyelid** (upper eyelid ptosis) — rare complication of glabellar treatment. Not a 999 emergency. Contact the clinic same day — the MD can prescribe eye drops that partially manage this while it resolves naturally over 2–8 weeks.

---

## 4.6 Non-Urgent Concerns — Contact the Clinic

- Visible asymmetry at your 2-week review — this is frequently addressable with a small top-up under your existing prescription
- Bruising that has not started to resolve by Day 7
- Brow heaviness or reduced brow elevation
