## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Skin Booster and Biorevitaliser therapy encompasses injectable treatments designed to improve intrinsic skin quality — hydration, elasticity, texture, luminosity, and collagen architecture — without volumisation. This pathway covers three product classes: **hyaluronic acid (HA) biorevitalisers** (e.g., Profhilo, Seventy Hyal, Juvederm Volite), **polynucleotide / PDRN treatments** (e.g., Nucleofill, Plinest, Rejuran), and **mesotherapy biorevitaliser cocktails** (e.g., NCTF 135HA, Jalupro). These are distinct from structural dermal fillers (MEN-CP-008): they do not add volume and are not used for anatomical projection or augmentation. Male skin presents specific clinical considerations — increased thickness, sebaceous density, follicular architecture in the beard zone, and characteristic photoageing patterns — which require technique modification relative to female protocols. All injectable anaesthetics are Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) requiring Manchester Medical Director (MD) prescription. The medical devices themselves (HA boosters, polynucleotides) are UKCA/CE-marked; MD product authorisation and supply chain compliance are verified before each treatment cycle. This pathway applies to all Menhancements clinic locations: **Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan**.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — EMLA AND INJECTABLE LIDOCAINE ARE POMs: MD PRESCRIPTION MANDATORY**
> Topical anaesthetic (EMLA cream: lidocaine 2.5% / prilocaine 2.5%) and injectable lidocaine are Prescription-Only Medicines. No anaesthesia may be applied and no treatment may commence without a valid, patient-specific, signed MD prescription on file. The practitioner does not prescribe.

> **NOTICE 2 — HYALURONIDASE IS A POM AND MUST BE IN-ROOM FOR ALL HA-BASED TREATMENTS**
> All HA-based skin boosters (Profhilo, Seventy Hyal, Juvederm Volite, Restylane Skinboosters) carry a vascular occlusion risk. Hyaluronidase (Hyalase — POM, MD prescription required) must be drawn up and physically present in the treatment room before the first HA syringe is opened. This is a non-negotiable pre-treatment gate. HA skin boosters injected at the incorrect depth or into a vessel can cause skin necrosis; treatment areas near named vessels or the periorbital zone are of particular concern.

> **NOTICE 3 — POLYNUCLEOTIDES ARE NOT REVERSIBLE: EXPLICIT DISCLOSURE MANDATORY**
> Polynucleotide (PDRN/PN) products (Nucleofill, Plinest, Plenhyage, Rejuran and equivalents) are not hyaluronic acid. There is no reversal agent. Complications from polynucleotide injection — including nodules, granulomas, or vascular events — cannot be dissolved. This irreversibility must be explicitly discussed with the patient and documented in the consent form prior to treatment. Patients must be offered the option of an HA-based protocol if they are unwilling to accept an irreversible treatment.

> **NOTICE 4 — POLYNUCLEOTIDE SUPPLY CHAIN AND UKCA COMPLIANCE: MD VERIFICATION REQUIRED**
> Many polynucleotide products originate from non-UK manufacturers (South Korea, Italy) and hold CE marking under EU MDR. Post-Brexit, the UK requires UKCA marking for medical devices; however, a transition period applies for legacy CE-marked devices. The MD must verify that each polynucleotide product used at Menhancements holds either UKCA marking or a valid CE marking within the applicable transition framework, and that the supply chain is traceable to a reputable UK-registered distributor. Counterfeit and sub-standard products are prevalent in this category. No product from an unverified supply chain may be used.

> **NOTICE 5 — BEARD ZONE INJECTION: MODIFIED TECHNIQUE AND FOLLICULAR AWARENESS**
> Injection into the beard zone (lower face, jawline, chin, upper lip) in male patients requires specific technique modification. The follicular density of male facial hair creates a risk of follicular disruption, post-injection pustule formation, and increased bruising due to the rich vascular supply of the follicular unit. Retrograde aspiration is not standard for skin boosters; however, awareness of the superficial temporal, facial, and labial arteries in these zones is mandatory. Needle depth must be confirmed in the appropriate layer (dermis or superficial subcutaneous) before injection.

## PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

### 1.1 Scope and Treatment Indications

This pathway governs the injectable delivery of skin boosters and biorevitalisers for skin quality optimisation in male patients at Menhancements clinic locations.

**Recognised clinical indications:**

| Indication | Relevant Product Class |
|---|---|
| Skin dehydration and dullness | HA biorevitalisers (Profhilo, Seventy Hyal, Juvederm Volite) |
| Loss of skin elasticity and early laxity | HA biorevitalisers; polynucleotides |
| Superficial rhytides and skin textural irregularity | Polynucleotides; mesotherapy cocktails |
| Post-acne scarring (atrophic, rolling, boxcar) | Polynucleotides; mesotherapy |
| Periorbital skin quality and under-eye crepiness | Polynucleotides (specific products for thin-skin zones) |
| Solar damage, enlarged pores, uneven tone | Mesotherapy cocktails; polynucleotides |
| Beard zone skin quality (folliculitis scarring, roughness) | Polynucleotides; targeted mesotherapy |
| Scalp skin quality (adjunct to MEN-CP-005 Hair Restoration) | Polynucleotides; mesotherapy |
| Neck and décolletage skin quality | HA biorevitalisers; polynucleotides |

> **Clinical Boundary:** Skin boosters do not volumise, lift, project, or replace structural filler treatments. Patients presenting with significant volume loss, deep structural hollowing, or severe skin laxity requiring lifting should be directed to MEN-CP-008 (Dermal Fillers). Do not conflate these pathways.

---

### 1.2 Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Known allergy to HA, bacterial proteins, or avian-derived products (for relevant products) | Anaphylaxis / hypersensitivity — formulation review by MD required |
| Known allergy to salmon or fish-derived products | Absolute CI for salmon-derived PDRN/PN products (Rejuran, Nucleofill, Plinest) |
| Known allergy to lidocaine, prilocaine, or amide-type local anaesthetics | CI for EMLA and injectable lidocaine — anaesthesia approach must be reconsidered by MD |
| Active skin infection, active acne flare, or open lesions at treatment site | Infection spread; treatment deferred until site is clear |
| Active cold sore (HSV) — perioral or perinasal zone | Perioral / perinasal treatment absolutely deferred until fully healed (minimum 14 days post-crusting) |
| Active autoimmune condition (e.g., lupus, active RA flare, Sjögren's syndrome) | Risk of granuloma formation and aberrant inflammatory response with both HA and polynucleotide products |
| History of anaphylaxis to injectable products without subsequent allergy assessment | MD must review allergy history and relevant test results before prescribing |
| Active malignancy at treatment site | Absolute CI — refer to oncology |
| Isotretinoin within the past 12 months | Impaired wound healing; abnormal scar response; defer treatment |
| BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder) — unresolved, untreated | Psychological screen must be passed; refer to appropriate psychological service if BDD suspected |

---

### 1.3 Relative Contraindications (MD Assessment Required)

| Contraindication | Required Action |
|---|---|
| History of hypersensitivity reactions to injectable cosmetic products | MD individual review; patch or split-dose test session if indicated |
| History of cold sores (HSV) — perioral zone treatment planned | Prophylactic aciclovir 400 mg TDS or valaciclovir 500 mg BD (POM — MD prescription) initiated 24 hours pre-treatment and continued for 5 days post-treatment |
| Keloid or hypertrophic scarring history | Higher risk of nodule or granuloma formation with any injectable product; MD consent discussion mandatory |
| Blood thinners (warfarin, DOAC, aspirin, high-dose omega-3) | Increased bruising risk; advise to pause if medically safe (GP approval); document decision |
| Active dental treatment or recent dental procedure (within 4 weeks) | Bacteraemia risk — defer HA skin booster treatment; polynucleotides may proceed with MD approval |
| Immunosuppressive therapy | Increased infection risk; slow wound healing; MD clinical assessment required |
| Diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled, HbA1c >75 mmol/mol) | Impaired wound healing; increased infection risk; MD clinical assessment |
| Severe facial rosacea (Grades III–IV) | Increased inflammatory response; modified treatment plan by MD |
| Significant needle phobia | Treat supine; topical anaesthesia maximised; vasovagal protocol active |

### 1.5 Product Classes and Formulations

#### Class A — HA Biorevitalisers

Injectable hyaluronic acid formulations designed for skin hydration and biostimulation. These are UKCA/CE-marked medical devices, not licensed medicines. They differ from structural fillers in rheology: lower G' (elasticity), higher spreadability, optimised for tissue integration rather than volumisation.

| Product | HA Content | Key Characteristics | Injection Depth | Session Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Profhilo (IBSA) | 64 mg/2 mL (H-HA + L-HA BDDE-free) | Bioremodeller; highest HA concentration available; spreads widely from BAP points | Deep dermis / superficial subcutaneous | 2 sessions × 4 weeks apart; review at 4 weeks post-session 2; maintenance every 6 months |
| Seventy Hyal 2000 | 70 mg/mL HA | High-molecular-weight HA; hydration and collagen stimulation | Mid-dermis | 3 sessions × 4 weeks apart; maintenance every 6 months |
| Juvederm Volite (Allergan) | 12 mg/mL cross-linked HA + 0.3% lidocaine | Licensed skin booster; cross-linked for longevity | Superficial dermis (nappage) | Single session; repeat at 9–12 months |
| Restylane Skinboosters (Galderma) | 20 mg/mL NASHA HA | Established skin booster; nappage or microdroplet technique | Superficial / mid-dermis | 3 sessions × 4 weeks apart; maintenance every 6 months |

> **Hyaluronidase Note:** All HA-based skin boosters are reversible with hyaluronidase, though BDDE-free HA (Profhilo) may require higher enzyme volumes due to absence of cross-linking. A dose of 300–600 IU is a reasonable starting point for skin booster vascular occlusion; reassess at 30–60 minutes and repeat as clinically indicated.

#### Class B — Polynucleotides (PDRN / PN)

Derived from purified salmon sperm DNA (most products) or plant sources (Plenhyage plant-derived). Mechanism: binds A2A adenosine receptors → fibroblast activation → collagen and elastin synthesis; angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. **These are NOT HA. There is no reversal agent.**

| Product | Active Component | Origin | Key Use Case | Injection Depth | Session Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nucleofill (Mastelli) | PDRN (polynucleotide) | Salmon | General skin quality, elasticity, hydration | Intradermal | 3–4 sessions × 4 weeks; maintenance 2–3×/year |
| Plinest / Newest (Mastelli) | PN (polynucleotide) high-concentration | Salmon | Skin texture, post-acne, photoageing | Intradermal | 3 sessions × 4 weeks; maintenance 2×/year |
| Plenhyage XL | PN (plant-derived) | Non-animal | Fish allergy patients; general biostimulation | Intradermal | 3 sessions × 4 weeks |
| Rejuran Healer | PDRN | Salmon | Periorbital, acne scarring, fine lines | Intradermal (papule) | 4 sessions × 2–4 weeks; maintenance 2×/year |

> **Supply Chain Requirement:** Polynucleotide products must be sourced from a verified UK-registered distributor holding UKCA marking or valid CE transition status documentation. Batch numbers and distributor details must be recorded per session. The MD is responsible for verifying supply chain compliance before authorising any product for clinic use.

#### Class C — Mesotherapy Biorevitaliser Cocktails

Multi-component injectable solutions containing combinations of HA, amino acids, vitamins, coenzymes, nucleic acids, and minerals. Delivered via nappage (multiple small intradermal injections) or linear threading.

| Product | Key Components | Indication | Session Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| NCTF 135HA (Fillmed) | 59 active ingredients + HA | Comprehensive biorevitalisation; photoageing; dull skin | 3–4 sessions × 2 weeks; maintenance monthly |
| Jalupro HMW (IBSA) | HA + amino acids (glycine, L-proline, L-leucine, L-lysine) | Skin laxity, scarring, tissue repair | 3 sessions × 3 weeks; maintenance 2×/year |
| Jalupro Classic | Amino acids only (no HA) | Early laxity, fine lines | 4 sessions × 3 weeks |
| Skin Renu / Lumi Eyes (if polynucleotide-containing) | PDRN + vitamins | Periorbital skin quality | 3 sessions × 4 weeks |

### 1.6 MD Prescribing Pathway

> The prescriber-practitioner split is absolute. The MD prescribes all POMs (EMLA, lidocaine, hyaluronidase) and authorises the specific medical device product, protocol, and treatment area. Practitioners do not prescribe.

| Stage | Responsible Party | Location | Required Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Initial enquiry and booking | Admin / Practitioner | Any location | Pre-consultation questionnaire issued; photographic policy confirmed |
| 2. Clinical assessment | Practitioner | Clinic (Manchester / Leeds / Wilmslow / Wigan) | Full history; contraindication screen; skin assessment; photographic baseline |
| 3. MD consultation | Manchester Medical Director | Manchester or remote (synchronous) | Skin quality assessment review; confirms indication; selects product class; rules out CIs; issues prescription |
| 4. MD prescription issued | Manchester Medical Director | Manchester | Patient-specific signed prescription for: EMLA (dose/area), lidocaine (if required), hyaluronidase (in-room authorisation), product class and specific product, protocol and session plan |
| 5. Day-of checklist | Practitioner | Clinic | Pre-treatment checklist completed (Section 1.7); consent confirmed |
| 6. Treatment delivery | Practitioner | Clinic | Protocol per Section 1.8; real-time monitoring |
| 7. Adverse event escalation | Practitioner → MD | Emergency escalation | Immediate (Section 1.10) |
| 8. Follow-up review | Practitioner + MD if needed | Clinic | 4-week post-session assessment; photographic comparison; next session or maintenance plan |

---

### 1.7 Pre-Treatment Protocol — Day of Treatment

**EMLA Application:**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm MD EMLA prescription on file. Apply a thick layer of EMLA cream to the entire planned treatment area. |
| 2 | Cover with occlusive dressing (Tegaderm or cling film). |
| 3 | Leave in place for a minimum of 45–60 minutes before treatment commences. |
| 4 | Remove dressing and EMLA. Clean the area with 70% isopropyl alcohol, allowing 30 seconds to dry. |

**Day-of Pre-Treatment Checklist:**

| # | Check | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | MD prescription on file — EMLA, hyaluronidase, product, area, protocol | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 2 | Patient contraindication screen reviewed and passed | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 3 | Active cold sore or skin infection at treatment site ruled out | ☐ Pass / ☐ Fail |
| 4 | HSV prophylaxis (if perioral treatment + HSV history): aciclovir/valaciclovir initiated ≥24 hours prior | ☐ Pass / ☐ N/A |
| 5 | Hyaluronidase (Hyalase) drawn up and in-room (HA product sessions only) | ☐ Pass / ☐ N/A |
| 6 | Polynucleotide product batch number and expiry date logged in patient record | ☐ Pass / ☐ N/A |

### 1.8 Treatment Protocols

#### Protocol A — Profhilo BAP (Bio Aesthetic Points) Technique

The BAP technique delivers Profhilo at 5 anatomically defined injection points per side of the face, each receiving 0.2 mL, for a total of 2 mL (one syringe) per session. The injection points are chosen to avoid named vessels and allow maximum tissue spread.

**Standard BAP Injection Points (Face):**

| Point | Location |
|---|---|
| Point 1 (Cheek) | Junction of zygomatic and buccal areas — lateral mid-cheek |
| Point 2 (Nasolabial) | Nasolabial fold mid-point — above the modiolus |
| Point 3 (Mandibular) | Mandibular border mid-point (pre-jowl sulcus zone) |
| Point 4 (Pre-auricular) | Anterior to tragus — temporal area |
| Point 5 (Chin) | Mental area, mid-chin lateral to midline |

**Injection Technique:**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm EMLA has been removed and site cleaned. Mark all 10 BAP points (bilateral) with an eyeliner or skin marker. |
| 2 | Use 27G or 29G needle, 13 mm. |
| 3 | At each BAP point: insert needle to deep dermis / superficial subcutaneous plane. Inject 0.2 mL slowly — no aspiration required at standard BAP points (these are established safe zones). |
| 4 | Apply gentle pressure post-injection with sterile gauze. Do not massage — Profhilo distributes by its own rheological properties. |
| 5 | Proceed to all 10 points; complete one side before moving to the contralateral side. |
| 6 | Observe for 15 minutes post-treatment. |

**Male-Specific BAP Modifications:**

- In male patients with dense beard growth, Points 2, 3, and 5 sit within or adjacent to the beard zone. Use a fresh needle for each injection (follicular drag increases with blunted needles). Ensure alcohol prep has fully dried before needle insertion.
- Male mandibular borders are typically more pronounced — adjust Point 3 slightly to avoid the dense periosteal region where product spread may be limited.
- Profhilo in male patients typically distributes less widely than in female patients owing to greater dermal thickness and lower skin compliance. A second session at 4 weeks is mandatory, not optional.

#### Protocol B — Polynucleotide Injection Technique

**Serial Papule (Nappage) Technique:**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Site decontamination with 70% isopropyl alcohol; allow to dry. |
| 2 | Use 30G or 32G × 4–6 mm needle. |
| 3 | Insert needle at 30–45° into mid-dermis. Inject 0.01–0.02 mL per papule. A visible small bleb should form on the skin surface. |
| 4 | Space papules approximately 1 cm apart in a grid pattern across the treatment zone. |
| 5 | Do not aspirate — the intradermal plane is not adjacent to named vessels at this depth. |
| 6 | Apply light pressure with gauze as you move between points. Do not massage. |
| 7 | Total volumes: per zone as per MD prescription (typically 1–2 mL per zone per session). |

**Linear Threading Technique (for Deeper PDRN Delivery):**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Insert 30G needle at 10–15° angle into mid-to-deep dermis. |
| 2 | Advance needle subcutaneously along planned thread line (0.5–1 cm per thread). |
| 3 | Inject on withdrawal, depositing product evenly along the thread length. |
| 4 | Maximum 0.1–0.2 mL per linear thread. |
| 5 | Apply light pressure. Do not massage. |

**Periorbital Zone (Under-Eye) — Specific Rules:**

- **Cannula ONLY** for the periorbital zone if delivering PN to the tear trough or infraorbital area in patients with thin under-eye skin.
- Needle injection in the periorbital zone carries a higher risk of bruising, vascular compromise, and oedema given the thin and highly vascular nature of this tissue.
- Maximum 0.3–0.5 mL per side per session in the periorbital zone.
- Slow, controlled injection; patient must maintain upright head position throughout.

#### Protocol C — Mesotherapy Cocktail (Nappage / Multi-Point)

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm product and volume per MD prescription. |
| 2 | Load into 1 mL syringe with 30G × 4 mm needle (or use mesotherapy gun if available and calibrated). |
| 3 | Clean site. Allow to dry. |
| 4 | Nappage technique: multiple small intradermal injections (0.01–0.02 mL) spaced 0.5–1 cm apart across the treatment zone. |
| 5 | Alternatively, linear threading at 0.1 mL per thread for linear zones. |
| 6 | Total volume typically 2–5 mL per full-face session, adjusted by MD prescription. |
| 7 | Apply gauze pressure between zones. No massage. |
| 8 | Apply cooling post-treatment. |

### 1.9 Emergency Management

#### A. Vascular Occlusion — Skin (HA Products)

**Recognition:** Immediate blanching or livedo reticularis at or remote to injection site; pain disproportionate to procedure; slow capillary refill; dusky discolouration. Most likely in HA booster protocols.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | STOP injecting immediately. |
| 2 | Apply warm compress to affected area — promote vasodilation. |
| 3 | Administer hyaluronidase — Hyalase 300–600 IU reconstituted in 1–2 mL water for injection — injected directly into and around the blanched area (multiple small blebs covering the zone). |
| 4 | Massage vigorously to disperse hyaluronidase throughout the affected zone. |
| 5 | Reassess at 30 minutes — if blanching persists: repeat hyaluronidase 300–600 IU. |
| 6 | Activate automated emergency escalation (Section 1.10). MD telephone guidance immediately. |
| 7 | If no resolution after two rounds of hyaluronidase: call 999 and transfer to emergency care. |
| 8 | MHRA Yellow Card. Full incident report. |

> **For polynucleotide vascular occlusion:** hyaluronidase is ineffective. Warm compress, massage, and aspirin 300 mg (if not contraindicated — crushed/dispersible) are the immediate supportive measures. 999 immediately. No delay.

#### B. Anaphylaxis

Refer to Section 1.9B of MEN-CP-008 (Dermal Fillers) for the full anaphylaxis protocol. Same protocol applies here. Adrenaline auto-injector must be in the treatment room.

| Step | Immediate Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | STOP. Call 999. Position patient flat, legs elevated (unless respiratory distress). |
| 2 | Adrenaline 0.5 mL 1:1000 IM — anterolateral thigh. |
| 3 | High-flow oxygen. |
| 4 | Activate automated emergency escalation (Section 1.10). |
| 5 | MHRA Yellow Card; incident report within 24 hours. |

#### C. HSV Reactivation (Post-Treatment Cold Sore)

**Recognition:** Tingling, burning, or cluster of vesicles appearing at or near perioral treatment zone within 24–72 hours post-treatment.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm diagnosis clinically (characteristic vesicular eruption at vermillion border or perioral skin). |
| 2 | Initiate antiviral immediately (if not already on prophylaxis): aciclovir 400 mg five times daily for 5 days, or valaciclovir 1g BD for 5 days (POM — MD same-day prescription). |
| 3 | Advise patient not to touch the area or spread lesion contents. |
| 4 | Document in patient record. |
| 5 | If severe, extensive, or immunocompromised patient: escalate to MD for urgent review and GP/hospital referral. |
| 6 | No further perioral treatment until full resolution + minimum 14 days post-crusting. |

#### D. Post-Injection Nodule or Granuloma

**Recognition:** Firm, visible, or palpable lump at injection site appearing days to weeks post-treatment.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Record location, size, consistency, skin changes (erythema, warmth). Photograph. |
| 2 | Determine product type (HA vs. polynucleotide). |
| 3 | **HA product nodule:** if early (<4 weeks): hyaluronidase injection (MD prescription, 75–150 IU per nodule). Reassess at 2 weeks. |
| 4 | **Polynucleotide / mesotherapy nodule:** no enzymatic reversal available. Intralesional triamcinolone (POM — MD must prescribe; specialist referral may be required) or watchful waiting depending on characteristics. |
| 5 | Escalate to MD for all nodule management decisions. Do not attempt to massage hard nodules aggressively. |
| 6 | If signs of infection (heat, erythema, fluctuance, pain): swab; systemic antibiotics (POM — MD prescription); refer if cellulitis risk. |

### 3.1 Description of Treatment

I consent to receiving injectable skin booster / biorevitaliser treatment at Menhancements. I understand this involves multiple small injections of a prescribed product into the skin of the treatment area(s) to improve skin quality, hydration, elasticity, and texture. This is not a volumising treatment and will not add structural projection or lift to any facial area.

**Treatment class(es) consented to today:**

☐ HA Biorevitaliser — specific product: _______________________________
☐ Polynucleotide (PDRN/PN) — specific product: _______________________________
☐ Mesotherapy Biorevitaliser Cocktail — specific product: _______________________________

**Treatment area(s) consented to:**

☐ Face ☐ Periorbital / Under-eye ☐ Neck ☐ Beard zone ☐ Scalp ☐ Hands ☐ Other: _______________

### 3.2 Off-Label and Medical Device Disclosure

**HA Biorevitalisers and Polynucleotide products are UKCA/CE-marked medical devices**, not licensed medicines. Their use for skin quality optimisation is within the intended scope of these devices; however, some specific treatment zones or patient populations may constitute off-label use, which the Manchester Medical Director has assessed and clinically justified.

**Polynucleotide products are NOT reversible.** There is no enzymatic or pharmacological agent that can dissolve or remove polynucleotide material once injected. I understand and accept this as a condition of treatment.

| Declaration | Patient Initials |
|---|---|
| I understand HA skin boosters are CE/UKCA medical devices used for skin quality, not volumisation | _______ |
| I understand polynucleotide products are not reversible and there is no antidote | _______ |
| I understand mesotherapy cocktail products are CE/UKCA medical devices, off-label use explained | _______ |

### 3.3 Risks and Potential Complications

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Redness, swelling, and bruising at injection sites | Very common | Mild; resolves within 3–7 days |
| Small bumps (papules / wheals) at injection points immediately post-treatment | Very common | Mild; resolves within 24–48 hours |
| Tenderness at treatment site | Common | Mild; 1–3 days |
| Headache (if forehead or scalp treated) | Common | Mild |
| Temporary worsening of skin texture before improvement | Uncommon | Mild–Moderate |
| Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (darker skin types) | Uncommon | Moderate; may persist weeks to months |
| Cold sore (HSV) reactivation following perioral treatment | Uncommon (if HSV history) | Moderate |
| Folliculitis in beard zone | Uncommon | Mild–Moderate |
| Persistent nodule or granuloma | Rare | Moderate–Serious; may require treatment |
| Infection at injection site | Rare | Moderate–Serious; requires antibiotics |
| Allergic reaction | Rare | Moderate |
| Anaphylaxis | Very rare | Life-threatening |
| Vascular occlusion (vessel compression / embolism) leading to skin necrosis | Very rare — risk mitigated by correct technique and depth | Serious |
| Hyaluronidase dissolving pre-existing HA filler in adjacent zone (if applicable) | Rare if filler history not declared | Moderate — proportionality of risk increases if patient has undisclosed existing filler |

---

### 3.4 Realistic Outcome Expectations

I understand and accept the following:

- Skin booster and biorevitaliser treatments improve **intrinsic skin quality** — hydration, glow, texture, fine lines. They do **not** volumise, lift, or replace structural treatments.
- Results are **gradual**. Improvement in skin quality typically becomes evident at 4–6 weeks post-treatment and continues to develop over the subsequent 2–3 months as collagen remodelling progresses.
- A **course of sessions** (typically 3, 4 weeks apart) is required to achieve optimal outcomes. A single session is unlikely to produce maximal results.
- Results are **not permanent**. Maintenance sessions are required to sustain improvement — typically every 6–12 months depending on product class and individual response.
- Individual response varies significantly based on skin type, age, lifestyle, sun exposure, and smoking status.
- Male skin, being thicker and more sebaceous, may show different response characteristics than female skin. Results may be subtler and may require higher product volumes over more sessions.

## PART 4: AFTERCARE PROTOCOL — MEN-CP-010

**Patient Copy — Issue at Discharge**

---

### 4.1 Immediately After Treatment

Injection points will be red, slightly swollen, and may have small surface bumps (papules) — this is normal and resolves within hours to 1–2 days. Bruising is common, particularly in the periorbital zone and beard area. Some patients experience mild tenderness.

Apply the provided cool pack (wrapped — not directly on skin) to treatment zones for 10–15 minutes before leaving the clinic.

---

### 4.2 First 24–48 Hours

- **Do not touch or rub the treatment area.** Let the product settle.
- **No makeup** on the treatment area for 12 hours.
- **No exercise, steam rooms, saunas, or hot showers** for 24 hours — heat increases swelling and bruising.
- **No alcohol** for 24 hours — increases bruising and inflammatory response.
- **No facial massage** or any pressure to the treatment area for 48 hours.
- **Shaving:** avoid shaving directly over treatment sites for 24–48 hours. Rinse, do not press or drag razor across areas that are still raised or bruised.
- **Sun exposure:** avoid direct sun exposure for 48 hours. Apply SPF 50+ after the first 12 hours if you need to go outdoors.
- **Hydration:** drink 1.5–2 litres of water per day to support skin hydration and lymphatic clearance of any bruising.

---

### 4.3 Days 3–14

- Bruising and swelling will continue to resolve. Yellow-brown bruising is normal healing.
- Your skin may feel temporarily uneven, tighter, or slightly "lumpy" in the first week — this is the product integrating into the dermis and is entirely normal.
- Continue SPF 50+ daily — this is one of the most important measures to protect your investment and maintain results.
- Avoid aggressive exfoliation, microneedling, or any skin-resurfacing treatment in the treated area for a minimum of 4 weeks.
- Avoid Profhilo-treated areas being manipulated at the hairdresser or during any face massage for 4 weeks.

---

### 4.4 Expected Side Effects by Timeline

| Side Effect | Expected Duration |
|---|---|
| Redness at injection points | Hours to 24 hours |
| Swelling and small papule bumps | 24–48 hours |
| Bruising (mild to moderate) | 5–10 days |
| Tenderness at treatment site | 1–3 days |
| Skin feeling "tight" or uneven | Days 1–7 (resolves as product integrates) |
| NAD+ / mesotherapy: temporary skin dryness before improvement | Weeks 1–3 |
| Results building (hydration, glow, texture) | Weeks 4–12 (gradual) |

---
