# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Scrotox — Botulinum Toxin Type A Scrotal Injection
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-002 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of Botulinum Toxin Type A injection to the scrotal dartos muscle ("Scrotox") at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan.

**This treatment uses a Prescription-Only Medicine (POM).** Botulinum Toxin Type A is classified as a POM under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended). Under the Menhancements prescribing model, the Manchester Medical Director (MD) is the **sole prescriber** for all Botulinum Toxin treatments across all clinic locations. **No Scrotox treatment may proceed at any clinic — Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, or Wigan — without a valid, patient-specific prescription issued by the Manchester MD on the patient's digital record.**

The treating Practitioner performs the physical injection. The MD prescribes but does not administer the treatment.

**Procedure summary:** Botulinum Toxin Type A is injected intradermally and into the superficial dartos muscle of the scrotum at multiple points, relaxing the scrotal smooth muscle. This produces a smoother, lower-resting scrotal appearance and reduces scrotal hyperhidrosis where present. Effects onset at 7–14 days and persist for 3–6 months.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context and maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023).

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRESCRIBING NOTICE

> **BOTULINUM TOXIN TYPE A IS A PRESCRIPTION-ONLY MEDICINE.**
>
> Under UK law and the Menhancements clinical governance framework:
> - The Manchester Medical Director MUST conduct a prescribing consultation with EVERY patient before their first Scrotox treatment
> - A new prescription is required for EACH treatment cycle unless the MD has issued a standing prescription protocol for an established patient (maximum 12-month validity; MD review required before renewal)
> - The Practitioner MUST verify the written prescription is present in the patient's digital record BEFORE reconstituting or opening any Botulinum Toxin product
> - Failure to verify the prescription before treatment commences constitutes a serious clinical governance breach

| **Session Duration** | 20–30 minutes (excluding EMLA application time) |
| **Repeat Frequency** | No more frequently than every 12 weeks |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

---

## 1.2 Indications

**Licensed / Off-Label Status:** Cosmetic scrotal injection is an off-label use of Botulinum Toxin Type A. This must be disclosed in full to the patient and documented in the consent form. Off-label prescribing is lawful in the UK when the prescriber (Manchester MD) has satisfied themselves it is clinically appropriate for the individual patient.

**Primary Indications:**
- Aesthetic: scrotal rejuvenation — reduction of excessive wrinkling, thickening, and retracted appearance of scrotal skin
- Scrotal hyperhidrosis — excessive sweating causing hygiene concern, irritation, or social impact
- Combined aesthetic and functional concern (most common presentation)

**Secondary / Supportive Indications:**
- Post-surgical scrotal cosmetic concern (MD assessment required — underlying pathology must be excluded)
- Chronic scrotal pruritus associated with hyperhidrosis (clinical assessment and dermatology review recommended)

---

## 1.3 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Clinical Rationale |
|---|---|
| Known hypersensitivity or allergy to Botulinum Toxin Type A or any product component (human albumin, lactose, sucrose — varies by brand) | Anaphylaxis risk |
| Neuromuscular junction disorder: myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or motor neurone disease | BoNT potentiates neuromuscular blockade — risk of generalised weakness and respiratory compromise |
| Active infection, inflammation, or open wound at the injection site | Risk of spreading infection; contraindicated per product SPC |
| Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) — current use | Potentiates neuromuscular blockade of BoNT — unpredictable dose effect |
| Lincosamide antibiotics (clindamycin) — current use | Potentiates BoNT — same mechanism |
| Patient under 18 years of age | Not licensed; not appropriate |
| Patient lacking capacity to consent | Legally prohibited |
| No valid MD prescription present on the patient record | **Clinical governance absolute stop — see prescribing notice above** |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Anticoagulant therapy (warfarin, DOAC) | MD to assess bruising risk; consider dose reduction of BoNT to reduce injection points; patient to acknowledge bruising risk in consent |
| Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) | MD to advise temporary cessation 5–7 days pre-treatment or document informed risk |
| History of previous BoNT treatment — any site | Document previous doses, products, and any adverse reactions before MD prescribes |
| Peripheral neuropathy | MD review — may affect expected clinical response |
| Recent surgery to the scrotal region (<3 months) | Structural assessment required; MD must review |
| Significant scrotal pathology (varicocele, hydrocele, post-orchidectomy, testicular implant) | MD assessment; urology involvement if appropriate |
| Concurrent neuromuscular-affecting medication (e.g., magnesium at high doses, spectinomycin, quinine) | MD to review drug interaction risk |
| Swallowing difficulties or respiratory muscle weakness (any cause) | BoNT may rarely spread systemically — MD risk assessment essential |
| Known anxiety or needle phobia | Pre-treatment management discussion; anxiolytic options per MD |

## 1.5 Botulinum Toxin Prescribing Pathway

### THE MANCHESTER MD IS THE SOLE PRESCRIBER FOR ALL BOTULINUM TOXIN AT MENHANCEMENTS

The following section defines the mandatory prescribing process. This process is non-negotiable and applies to every patient, at every clinic, for every Scrotox treatment.

---

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (at any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 20–30 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Completes the Dynamic Consultation Form (Part 2) in full
2. Records the patient's primary concern (aesthetic / hyperhidrosis / combined) and expectation baseline
3. Photographs the treatment area (front, bilateral — 3 angles minimum) with patient consent, stored in digital record
4. Completes full medical history and medication review
5. Screens all absolute and relative contraindications (Section 1.3)
6. **Does NOT prescribe Botulinum Toxin or any POM**
7. **Does NOT open, reconstitute, or prepare any Botulinum Toxin product**
8. Completes the MD Referral Trigger Checklist (Part 2, Section D)
9. Transmits completed assessment to the Manchester MD via secure clinical platform

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation (standard for Leeds/Wilmslow/Wigan patients) OR in-person at Manchester clinic
**Timing:** Must be completed before treatment session — same day is acceptable if MD is available and consultation can be completed in full

**The MD:**
1. Reviews Practitioner's assessment and referral documentation
2. Reviews contraindication screen and any flags raised
3. Conducts independent clinical assessment with patient (history, medical background, treatment goals)
4. Explicitly discusses the off-label nature of this treatment and documents this in the patient record
5. Assesses and documents clinical justification for prescribing
6. Determines exact Botulinum Toxin product, dose (units), dilution protocol, and injection map
7. Issues a **written patient-specific prescription** for:
   - Botulinum Toxin Type A (product name, dose in units)
   - EMLA cream (lidocaine 2.5% / prilocaine 2.5%)
8. Records the prescription in the digital patient record — visible to the treating Practitioner
9. Signs and dates the prescription entry with GMC number
10. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

> **PRESCRIPTION MUST STATE:**
> Patient name | Date of birth | Product name | Total units | Dilution | Injection protocol approved | Date of prescription | MD name and GMC number | MD signature

---

### STAGE 3 — Prescription Verification by Practitioner (Day of Treatment)

Before ANY preparation begins, the Practitioner performs a mandatory prescription check:

- [ ] Open patient's digital record
- [ ] Confirm MD prescription is present, dated, and signed
- [ ] Confirm the product on the prescription matches the product in the clinic stock
- [ ] Confirm the dose (units) on the prescription
- [ ] Confirm the patient's identity matches the prescription (full name + DOB)
- [ ] Confirm the prescription date is valid (not expired)
- [ ] Initial the verification step in the digital record

**If ANY item in the above checklist cannot be confirmed → STOP. Do not proceed. Contact MD.**

---

### STAGE 4 — Treatment Delivery

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner, following verified prescription
**Protocol:** See Section 1.6

---

## 1.6 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT (All Steps Mandatory)

**P-1.** Verify patient identity — full name and date of birth against digital record.

**P-2.** Complete prescription verification checklist (Stage 3 above). **Do not proceed without confirmed MD prescription.**

**P-3.** Confirm Informed Consent (Part 3) is on file, signed by patient and countersigned by MD (prescribing sign-off section). Obtain verbal confirmation of ongoing consent on the day.

**P-4.** Review consultation form for any new symptoms, new medications, or new medical conditions since assessment. If new contraindications are present — **STOP. Contact MD before proceeding.**

**P-5.** Ask patient to confirm no aminoglycoside or lincosamide antibiotics commenced since consultation. If yes — **STOP. Do not administer BoNT. Contact MD.**

**P-6.** Room preparation: treatment couch with disposable cover, good directional lighting, sterile field prepared, sharps bin positioned, clinical waste accessible, emergency equipment confirmed accessible in clinic.

**P-7.** Photograph treatment area (standardised positions, consistent with baseline photographs from consultation). Store in digital record.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA ANAESTHETIC APPLICATION

**Step 1.** Confirm EMLA prescription is on the patient record.

**Step 2.** Ask patient to undress from the waist down. Position supine on treatment couch. Ensure privacy and dignity throughout.

**Step 3.** Apply EMLA cream (as prescribed by MD) in a thick, generous, uniform layer across the entire scrotal skin surface. Extend slightly onto the penoscrotal junction if that area is within the treatment zone.

**Step 4.** Apply occlusive dressing (Tegaderm or cling film). Record application time in digital record.

**Step 5.** Wait minimum **45–60 minutes** for full anaesthetic effect. Patient may remain covered during this period.

**Step 6.** At 45–60 minutes: remove dressing and cream completely. Confirm anaesthesia via gentle light-touch and pin-prick test. If inadequate — wait an additional 15 minutes and retest. **Do not proceed if anaesthesia is insufficient** — re-application for a further period is acceptable if the procedure can still be completed within the session.

---

### PHASE 2 — BOTULINUM TOXIN RECONSTITUTION

> Reconstitution must follow the MD's prescribed dilution exactly. Document reconstitution in real time.

**Step 7.** Remove Botulinum Toxin vial from storage (confirm product name, batch number, expiry date — record all three in digital record).

**Step 8.** Reconstitute per MD-prescribed protocol using 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection (BP):
- Typical dilution for scrotal use: 100 units / 2–4 mL saline (yields 25–50 units/mL)
- Exact dilution per MD prescription — do NOT deviate
- Inject diluent gently into the vial — do NOT shake. Rotate gently until solution is clear and colourless.
- Draw reconstituted BoNT into 1 mL syringe with 30G needle.

**Step 9.** Label the syringe with: patient initials, product name, units/mL, time of reconstitution.

> **Use reconstituted product within 4 hours** (per manufacturer guidance). Do not store reconstituted product.

---

### PHASE 3 — INJECTION DELIVERY

**Step 10.** Cleanse the entire scrotal surface with chlorhexidine 0.5% or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Allow to fully air dry (do NOT blow dry — spray contamination risk).

**Step 11.** Position sterile drape around the treatment area. Maintain aseptic non-touch technique throughout.

**Step 12.** Review MD's injection map (documented in prescription/treatment plan). Standard distribution:

| Zone | Injection Points | Volume per Point | Total Units (Typical) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anterior scrotal body | 8–12 points in grid pattern | 0.05–0.1 mL | 40–60 units |
| Lateral scrotal folds | 2–4 points per side | 0.05 mL | 10–20 units |
| Posterior / perineal scrotal fold | 2–4 points (if indicated) | 0.05 mL | 10–20 units |
| **Total** | **12–20 injection points** | | **25–100 units (MD-specified)** |

> Injection grid and total dose must match MD prescription exactly. Do not add points or increase dose.

**Step 13.** Grasp scrotal skin gently between thumb and forefinger to stabilise tissue. Insert 30G needle bevel-up at a 10–15° angle. Target: intradermal to superficial subdermal plane (dartos layer). Depth: 2–4 mm.

**Step 14.** Inject 0.05–0.1 mL per point using slow, consistent pressure. A small bleb should be visible on injection (confirms intradermal placement). If no resistance is felt and no bleb forms — needle is too deep; reposition.

**Step 15.** Withdraw needle. Apply gentle pressure with sterile gauze. Do NOT massage injection sites.

**Step 16.** Move to next injection point. Change needle if blunting is noted (every 8–10 injections as minimum).

**Step 17.** Complete all injection points per MD map. Record total units administered, number of injection points, and any deviations from the plan in the digital record.

**Step 18.** Dispose of all sharps immediately into sharps bin. Do NOT recap needles.

---

### POST-TREATMENT CHECKS (Mandatory Before Discharge)

**Step 19.** Observe patient in clinic for minimum **20 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Vasovagal episode (pallor, diaphoresis, bradycardia, syncope)
- Allergic or anaphylactic reaction (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, tachycardia)
- Significant haematoma or unexpected swelling
- Any systemic BoNT effects (weakness, visual disturbance, dysphagia — rare but reportable)

**Step 20.** Apply a light, clean cold pack (in cloth — not direct skin contact) for 5 minutes to reduce bruising if required. Do NOT massage.

**Step 21.** Complete post-treatment digital record entry: product used, batch number, units administered per zone, patient response, any adverse events.

**Step 22.** Provide patient with printed Aftercare Protocol (Part 4).

**Step 23.** Book follow-up review: 2-week post-treatment assessment (clinical photography + patient-reported outcome). Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up call/SMS via CRM.

---

## 1.7 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

> This protocol activates for ALL Grade 3+ adverse events. Anaphylaxis or suspected systemic BoNT spread triggers immediate 999 call AND full escalation simultaneously.

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Expected: bruising, minor swelling, mild discomfort | Document in app. Monitor. Advise per aftercare. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: significant haematoma, pain persisting >4 hours, marked swelling | Document in app. Telephone MD directly. Record MD guidance. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: anaphylaxis, suspected systemic BoNT spread (dysphagia, diplopia, generalised weakness, respiratory difficulty), severe infection | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION PROTOCOL** |

### Full Escalation Protocol — Severe Adverse Event

**Step E-1: Immediate Patient Safety — CALL 999 FIRST FOR LIFE-THREATENING EVENTS**
- **Anaphylaxis:** IM adrenaline 0.5 mg (anterolateral thigh). Call 999. ABCDE. Keep patient supine with legs elevated.
- **Suspected systemic BoNT spread (dysphagia/respiratory):** Call 999 immediately. Position patient upright. Do NOT give anything by mouth. Prepare to support airway.
- **Vasovagal:** Supine position, legs elevated, monitor vitals. Usually self-resolving. Escalate if no recovery in 5 minutes.

**Step E-2: Digital Logging — Trigger Automated Escalation**
Practitioner logs the complication in the Menhancements digital app:
- Select: **"Adverse Event Report"**
- Enter: Patient ID, product name and batch number, units administered, complication type, severity grade, time of onset, actions taken
- Submit the report

**Step E-3: Automated Webhook Activation**
App submission automatically fires the integration pipeline:

```
Digital App  →  Webhook  →  Zapier (workflow trigger)
                                    ↓

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Scrotox — Botulinum Toxin Type A Scrotal Injection
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete, honest information about the treatment you are considering. You may take as much time as needed to read this before signing. You have the right to ask any questions and to withdraw consent at any time before or during treatment, without any negative effect on your care.

---

## 3.2 The Treatment

Botulinum Toxin Type A (a protein derived from Clostridium botulinum) is injected into the skin and superficial muscle layer of the scrotum at multiple points. This temporarily blocks nerve signals to the scrotal smooth muscle (dartos), causing relaxation and a smoother, lower-hanging appearance. Where scrotal sweating is a concern, the same mechanism reduces sweat gland activity.

A topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA — a prescription-only mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine) is applied to the scrotal skin approximately one hour before injection to minimise discomfort. The injection procedure itself takes approximately 20–30 minutes.

---

## 3.3 Prescription-Only Medicine — Your Rights

Botulinum Toxin Type A is a **Prescription-Only Medicine** under UK law. It has been prescribed specifically for you by the Menhancements Manchester Medical Director following a clinical consultation. The Medical Director has assessed your suitability, reviewed your medical history, confirmed the dose, and issued a written prescription. The Medical Director does not perform the injection; your treating Practitioner does.

You have the right to see a copy of your prescription. Please ask if you would like one.

---

## 3.4 Off-Label Use Disclosure

The injection of Botulinum Toxin into the scrotum is an **off-label use** of this medicine. This means the manufacturer has not sought regulatory approval specifically for this indication. However, off-label prescribing by a qualified doctor is entirely lawful in the UK and is common across many areas of medicine when clinical evidence supports its use. The Manchester Medical Director has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied this treatment is appropriate for you. You have the right to ask the MD to discuss this evidence with you.

## 3.5 Realistic Outcomes

**Results are not guaranteed.** Based on clinical experience and available evidence, the following outcomes are possible:

- Visible smoothing and relaxation of scrotal skin within 7–14 days
- Reduction in hyperhidrosis symptoms (where applicable) within 7–14 days
- Duration of effect: 3–6 months (may vary; some patients report up to 8 months)
- Repeat treatment is required to maintain results
- Non-response or partial response occurs in some patients — factors include individual anatomy and baseline muscle tone

No specific outcome has been promised to you. Any guarantee of result would be inaccurate.

## 3.6 Risks and Potential Complications

**Common (expected and typically temporary):**
- Bruising at injection sites (resolves within 7–14 days)
- Mild swelling and tenderness (resolves within 48–72 hours)
- Small raised blebs at injection points (resolves within hours)
- Temporary sensitivity at injection sites

**Uncommon:**
- Haematoma (larger bruise/blood collection) requiring monitoring
- Mild, temporary asymmetry in scrotal appearance
- Skin pigmentation change at injection points (usually temporary)
- Delayed onset requiring longer than 14 days for effect

**Rare but serious:**
- Infection at injection site (requiring antibiotics or medical treatment)
- Allergic or anaphylactic reaction to Botulinum Toxin or EMLA components — medical emergency (clinic carries emergency medication)
- Spread of Botulinum Toxin beyond the injection site — this is rare with the doses used, but may cause: generalised weakness, drooping, double vision, or (very rarely) difficulty swallowing or breathing. If you experience any of these symptoms after treatment, call 999 immediately
- Unsatisfactory aesthetic result requiring correction or additional treatment

**Long-term / unknown risks:**
- Repeated treatments over many years have not been studied in this specific anatomical location. Long-term effects on scrotal tissue are not fully established. You accept this uncertainty.

## 3.7 Alternatives

You have been made aware of the following alternatives:
- No treatment
- Compression underwear (for hyperhidrosis management)
- Topical antiperspirants (for mild hyperhidrosis — limited efficacy)
- Surgical options (not typically indicated for cosmetic concern alone)

**Patient Copy — Keep This Document**

**Treatment received:** Scrotox (Botulinum Toxin Type A — Scrotal Injection)
**Date of treatment:** _____________
**Clinic:** _____________
**Your treating Practitioner:** _____________
**Follow-up appointment:** _____________

---

## 4.1 What to Expect

**In the first 24–48 hours:**
- Small raised bumps or blebs at injection points — normal, resolves within hours
- Mild redness, swelling, and tenderness at injection sites — normal, resolves within 48–72 hours
- Bruising — may develop over 24–48 hours and resolve within 7–14 days

**At 7–14 days:**
- The smoothing and relaxation effect should become visible
- Hyperhidrosis improvement (if applicable) typically apparent within 10–14 days
- Full effect may not be seen until 14 days post-treatment

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — Follow Exactly

**Position after treatment:**
- Remain upright (seated or standing) for **4 hours** after injection. Do not lie flat or apply sustained pressure to the treated area for 4 hours.

**Physical activity:**
- Avoid vigorous physical exercise, cycling, or intense pressure on the scrotal area for **24 hours**.
- After 24 hours, normal light activity is acceptable.
- Return to full exercise at 48 hours.

**Hygiene:**
- Do not wash the treated area for **6 hours** post-treatment.
- After 6 hours: normal showering is fine. Use gentle, unperfumed soap.
- No swimming, hot tubs, or saunas for **48 hours**.

**Temperature:**
- Avoid heat exposure to the treated area (hot baths, saunas, direct heat) for **24 hours**. Heat can accelerate Botulinum Toxin diffusion.
- Cold packs (wrapped in cloth — not direct skin contact) may be used for comfort in the first 2 hours if bruising is uncomfortable.

**Massage:**
- **Do NOT massage or rub the treated area at any point.** Massage can cause the Botulinum Toxin to migrate to unintended areas.

**Medications:**
- **Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) for 48 hours** — increases bruising risk.
- Use paracetamol for pain relief if needed.
- Continue all prescribed medications as normal unless your MD has advised otherwise.

**Sexual activity:**
- Avoid sexual activity for **24 hours** post-treatment.

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for **24 hours** (increases bruising and vasodilation).

## 4.3 Optimising Your Results

- Avoid saunas, steam rooms, and prolonged hot baths for the first week — heat metabolises Botulinum Toxin faster.
- Stay well hydrated.
- Attend your 2-week follow-up assessment — this is when clinical photographs are taken and your response is evaluated. If the effect is uneven or insufficient, a MD-reviewed top-up dose may be appropriate at this point.
- Results last 3–6 months on average. Plan your repeat treatment accordingly — there is a minimum interval of **12 weeks** between sessions.

## 4.4 Emergency Red Flags — Seek Immediate Medical Attention (999 / A&E)

**Call 999 or go to A&E immediately if you experience:**

🔴 **Difficulty swallowing, speaking, or breathing** — these are signs that Botulinum Toxin may have spread beyond the injection site. This is a medical emergency. Call 999 immediately. Tell the paramedics or A&E team that you have received Botulinum Toxin injection.

🔴 **Generalised muscle weakness, drooping of eyelids, or double vision** — potential systemic BoNT effect. Call 999.

🔴 **Rash, difficulty breathing, throat tightening, or collapse** — signs of anaphylaxis. Call 999.

🔴 **Rapidly spreading redness, warmth, and increasing pain beyond 48 hours** — may indicate infection. A&E or urgent GP.

🔴 **Fever >38°C within 72 hours of treatment** — seek urgent medical assessment.
