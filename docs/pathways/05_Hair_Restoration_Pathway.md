# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Hair Restoration — Scalp PRP, Microneedling & Medical Hair Loss Treatment
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-005 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of hair restoration treatment at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. The pathway addresses androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) through a dual-track approach:

**Track 1 — Procedural:** Scalp Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections and/or scalp microneedling. These stimulate hair follicle activity through growth factor delivery and controlled wound-healing response. PRP is administered by the treating Practitioner at clinic. Microneedling may be used as a standalone adjunct or to enhance PRP uptake.

**Track 2 — Pharmaceutical:** Medical hair loss treatment using one or more Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) — finasteride, dutasteride, and/or oral minoxidil — prescribed by the Manchester Medical Director to address the underlying hormonal driver of androgenetic alopecia. These medications treat the cause; PRP treats the consequence. The combination of both tracks produces superior outcomes to either alone.

**Prescribing model:** The Manchester Medical Director (MD) is the **sole prescriber** for all POMs in this pathway. Pharmaceutical treatment cannot commence without a MD prescribing consultation. The treating Practitioner administers PRP and microneedling but does not prescribe any medicine.

**Sexual side-effect disclosure — mandatory:** Finasteride and dutasteride inhibit 5-alpha reductase and reduce dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Known side effects include erectile dysfunction, reduced libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction. In a clinic that also manages men's sexual health, this interaction must be disclosed clearly and documented before any DHT blocker is prescribed. Men already receiving treatment for erectile dysfunction at Menhancements must have this co-prescribing flagged to the MD for individual risk-benefit assessment.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — THREE POMs REQUIRE MD PRESCRIPTION BEFORE TREATMENT BEGINS**
> (1) EMLA cream (topical anaesthetic for scalp PRP). (2) Finasteride, dutasteride, and/or oral minoxidil (pharmaceutical track). (3) No POM-dependent treatment step proceeds without a valid MD prescription confirmed on the patient digital record.

> **NOTICE 2 — SEXUAL SIDE-EFFECT COUNSELLING IS MANDATORY FOR DHT BLOCKERS**
> Finasteride and dutasteride can cause erectile dysfunction, reduced libido, ejaculatory dysfunction, and — in a subset of men — persistent sexual, cognitive, and mood symptoms beyond cessation (post-finasteride syndrome). This must be discussed explicitly with every patient before a DHT blocker is prescribed. Men already receiving treatment for erectile dysfunction at Menhancements must have both treatments flagged to the MD simultaneously.

> **NOTICE 3 — PSA EFFECT OF DHT BLOCKERS**
> Finasteride reduces serum PSA by approximately 50%. Dutasteride reduces PSA by approximately 50–60%. Any patient on a DHT blocker who has PSA testing must have their result interpreted with this suppression in mind. The MD must document this adjustment in the patient record.

> **NOTICE 4 — TERATOGENICITY**
> Finasteride and dutasteride are teratogenic to male fetuses. Crushed or broken tablets must not be handled by women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Patients must use effective contraception if their partner is or may become pregnant, or use intact tablets only and avoid contact with broken tablets. Document counselling.

# PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

---

## 1.1 Treatment Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment Name** | Hair Restoration — Scalp PRP + Microneedling + Medical Hair Loss Treatment |
| **Primary Indication** | Androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) — Norwood-Hamilton Grade I–VI |
| **Procedural Component 1** | Scalp Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections — autologous PRP delivered intradermally to the scalp to deliver growth factors to hair follicles |
| **Procedural Component 2** | Scalp microneedling — controlled micro-injury stimulating wound-healing response and enhancing topical PRP absorption; used as standalone or PRP adjunct |
| **Pharmaceutical Component** | Finasteride 1 mg (POM); Dutasteride 0.5 mg (POM, off-label); Oral Minoxidil 0.625–2.5 mg (POM); used individually or in MD-determined combination |
| **POMs in this pathway** | EMLA cream; Finasteride; Dutasteride; Oral Minoxidil — all prescribed exclusively by Manchester MD |
| **Topical Minoxidil 5%** | Available over-the-counter for men in the UK (Regaine for Men); not a POM; may be recommended as adjunct; patient self-sources |
| **PRP Session Protocol** | 3–6 sessions at 4–6 week intervals (induction); then 1–2 maintenance sessions per year |
| **Pharmaceutical Duration** | Long-term / indefinite — continued use required to maintain effect; cessation results in resumption of hair loss within 6–12 months |
| **Evidence Base** | Gkini et al. (2014); Gentile et al. (2015); Alves & Grimalt (2018) — PRP for AGA; Finasteride FDA-approved for AGA (1997); Dutasteride approved for AGA in South Korea, Japan; extensive RCT evidence for both |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

---

## 1.2 Clinical Staging — Norwood-Hamilton Classification

> The Norwood-Hamilton Scale must be assessed and documented at baseline and at each review. It guides treatment selection, realistic outcome expectations, and the appropriateness of PRP.

| Norwood-Hamilton Grade | Description | Recommended Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade I** | No significant recession; minimal temples | Medical treatment (finasteride ± minoxidil). PRP optional. |
| **Grade II** | Slight recession at temples; hairline intact | Medical treatment. PRP recommended for early intervention. |
| **Grade III** | Defined temporal recession; vertex involvement beginning (III Vertex) | Combined medical + PRP. Good response zone. |
| **Grade IV** | Extensive temporal recession; significant vertex thinning; mid-scalp band intact | Combined medical + PRP. Realistic expectations — density improvement likely, full restoration unlikely. |
| **Grade V** | Temporal and vertex zones merging | Combined medical + PRP for retention. Outcomes moderate. Hair transplant discussion appropriate. |
| **Grade VI** | Temporal and vertex fully merged; narrow fringe | Medical treatment for retention primarily. PRP of limited benefit. Hair transplant discussion recommended. |
| **Grade VII** | Only narrow band of hair remaining around sides/back | Medical treatment for retention only. PRP not recommended. Hair transplant consultation strongly recommended. Realistic expectation setting essential. |

> `IF Grade VI or VII → MD must conduct explicit expectation management discussion before any PRP sessions are booked. Document outcome.`

## 1.3 Indications

**Primary Indications — Scalp PRP:**
- Androgenetic alopecia, Norwood-Hamilton Grade I–V (Grade VI considered on MD assessment)
- Alopecia areata — limited, patchy (MD assessment; evidence base weaker; off-label use)
- Telogen effluvium — post-shedding recovery phase support
- Post-hair transplant recovery — PRP to enhance graft survival (within 14 days of transplant, in coordination with transplant surgeon)

**Primary Indications — Pharmaceutical Track (MD-prescribed):**
- Androgenetic alopecia (any Norwood grade) — first-line intervention to halt progression
- Alopecia areata — oral minoxidil may be considered (MD decision; off-label)

**Not Indicated:**
- Scarring alopecia (lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, discoid lupus) — MD referral to dermatology required; PRP contraindicated in active scarring process
- Alopecia totalis or universalis — MD referral to dermatology / immunology required

---

## 1.4 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Applies To |
|---|---|
| Active scalp infection (bacterial folliculitis, tinea capitis, impetigo, active psoriatic plaque at injection site) | Scalp PRP + Microneedling |
| Active open wounds or significant skin breakdown at treatment site | Both procedural |
| Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine or prilocaine — without alternative anaesthetic plan from MD | Scalp PRP (EMLA required) |
| Coagulopathy or active anticoagulant therapy without medical clearance | Scalp PRP (bleeding risk) |
| Thrombocytopenia (platelets <100 × 10⁹/L) | Scalp PRP |
| Active haematological malignancy | Scalp PRP |
| Desired pregnancy in partner within planned treatment window — without teratogenicity counselling completed | Finasteride / Dutasteride |
| Confirmed prostate or male breast cancer | Finasteride / Dutasteride (androgens implicated) |
| Hypersensitivity to finasteride, dutasteride, or any excipient | Respective pharmaceutical |
| Severe cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension | Oral Minoxidil (vasodilatory effect) |
| Patient under 18 years of age | All treatments |
| No valid MD prescription for POMs | POM-dependent steps |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Scarring alopecia (suspected or confirmed) | MD + dermatology referral; defer PRP |
| Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy | MD review; cessation guidance or proceed with documented risk |
| Active systemic autoimmune disease | MD review; may affect PRP inflammatory response |
| Patient concurrently receiving TRT at Menhancements | FLAG to MD: TRT increases testosterone → increased DHT substrate. DHT blocker dose may need adjustment. Co-prescribing must be MD-coordinated. |
| Patient concurrently receiving ED treatment at Menhancements | FLAG to MD: DHT blockers can worsen or cause ED. Simultaneous prescribing requires explicit MD risk-benefit documentation. |
| PSA previously measured — now adding finasteride/dutasteride | FLAG to MD: future PSA results must be interpreted with 50% suppression factor in mind. Document in record. |
| Depression or significant mood disorder | Finasteride and dutasteride have documented associations with mood disturbance and depression. MD review; psychiatric co-management if indicated. |
| Liver disease | Finasteride and dutasteride are hepatically metabolised. MD review; LFTs recommended. |
| History of post-finasteride syndrome (on prior finasteride course) | FLAG to MD. Significant — may preclude re-prescribing. MD clinical decision with documented informed consent. |
| Norwood Grade VI–VII | MD expectation management consultation required before booking PRP sessions |
| Significant diffuse thinning without clear androgenetic pattern | Investigate cause before treating (thyroid, iron, nutritional deficiency, systemic disease) |

---

## 1.5 Mandatory Baseline Investigations

> Required before any pharmaceutical track is initiated. Procedural PRP may commence independently of pharmaceutical track, subject to contraindication clearance and EMLA prescription.

| Investigation | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Full blood count (FBC)** | Platelet count (PRP prerequisite); haemoglobin; anaemia as a hair loss cause |
| **Ferritin** | Low ferritin is a common and reversible cause of hair shedding in men; must be excluded |
| **Thyroid function (TSH ± free T4)** | Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism both cause hair loss; must be excluded |
| **Serum testosterone + SHBG** | Androgen status; relevant to DHT blocker prescribing; relevant if concurrent TRT |
| **PSA** (if age ≥40, or any age if DHT blocker is being prescribed) | Baseline PSA before finasteride/dutasteride — essential for future comparison (PSA will be suppressed by DHT blocker) |
| **LFTs** (if finasteride or dutasteride is planned) | Hepatic metabolism of DHT blockers |
| **HbA1c** (if clinically indicated) | Diabetes as a contributing factor to diffuse hair loss |
| **Serum vitamin D, zinc** (if clinically indicated) | Nutritional contributors to hair health |
| **Blood pressure** (if oral minoxidil is planned) | Minoxidil is a vasodilator; baseline BP required |
| **Norwood-Hamilton grade — assessed and documented** | Clinical staging — mandatory |
| **Standardised baseline photography** | Four-angle minimum (frontal, vertex, bilateral lateral) — mandatory before first session |

---

## 1.6 Pharmaceutical Track — MD-Prescribed Medicines

> All prescribing decisions are the Manchester MD's clinical judgement. Practitioners do not prescribe, modify doses, or substitute products.

### Finasteride 1 mg (Propecia / generic)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Selective inhibitor of type II 5-alpha reductase → reduces scalp and serum DHT by ~65–70% |
| **Indication** | Androgenetic alopecia in men — licensed |
| **Dose** | 1 mg orally once daily |
| **Onset** | Hair loss halted within 3–6 months; regrowth evidence at 6–12 months; full assessment at 12 months |
| **Duration** | Long-term / indefinite; effect is sustained only during treatment |
| **Sexual side effects** | Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, ejaculatory disorder reported in 1–4% in clinical trials; persistent symptoms after cessation (post-finasteride syndrome) documented in a subset |
| **PSA effect** | Reduces serum PSA by approximately 50% — baseline PSA mandatory; future PSA results must be doubled for clinical interpretation |
| **Teratogenicity** | Teratogenic to male fetuses — handling precautions mandatory |
| **Monitoring** | PSA at 6 and 12 months (then annually); LFTs at 6 months; symptom review |

### Dutasteride 0.5 mg (Avodart / generic) — Off-Label for AGA

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Dual inhibitor of type I AND type II 5-alpha reductase → reduces scalp DHT by ~90%; serum DHT by ~95% |
| **Indication** | Androgenetic alopecia — off-label in UK (licensed for BPH); must be disclosed as off-label use |
| **Dose** | 0.5 mg orally once daily (per MD prescription) |
| **Onset** | Similar to finasteride; some evidence of superior efficacy |
| **Duration** | Long-term / indefinite |
| **Sexual side effects** | Similar to finasteride; possibly similar or slightly higher incidence due to greater DHT suppression |
| **PSA effect** | Reduces PSA by approximately 50–60% — greater suppression than finasteride; document |
| **Teratogenicity** | As finasteride — teratogenic to male fetuses |
| **Monitoring** | PSA at 6 and 12 months (then annually); LFTs at 6 months; symptom review |

### Oral Minoxidil (off-label for AGA)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|

## 1.8 Prescribing & Consultation Pathway

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 30–40 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Records hair loss history — onset, rate of progression, family history, prior treatments
2. Assesses and documents Norwood-Hamilton grade with clinical photographs (baseline set — mandatory)
3. Identifies areas of concern and patient goals
4. Completes full medical history and medication review — specifically flags:
   - Any concurrent Menhancements treatments (TRT, ED treatment — cross-reference MEN-CP-004, MEN-CP-001)
   - Anabolic steroid use (accelerates androgenetic alopecia — flag to MD)
   - Any current hair loss medications (including over-the-counter topical minoxidil)
5. Requests or confirms baseline investigations are on file (Section 1.5)
6. Screens all contraindications
7. **Does NOT prescribe any POM**
8. Completes MD Referral Trigger Checklist and transmits to Manchester MD

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation OR in-person (Manchester)
**Required for:** All pharmaceutical track initiations; Norwood Grade VI–VII assessment; any patient with concurrent Menhancements treatments; any patient with relative contraindications

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner's assessment, photographs, and all baseline investigations
2. Confirms Norwood-Hamilton grade and treatment plan appropriateness
3. Assesses concurrent treatments — specifically co-prescribing risk if patient is on TRT or ED treatment
4. Conducts mandatory sexual side-effect counselling for finasteride/dutasteride (documented verbally and in consent form)
5. Conducts teratogenicity counselling for finasteride/dutasteride
6. Discloses off-label status of dutasteride and/or oral minoxidil where applicable
7. Selects pharmaceutical regimen (finasteride alone / dutasteride alone / finasteride + oral minoxidil / dutasteride + oral minoxidil — per clinical judgement)
8. Issues written prescriptions for:
   - EMLA cream (for Scalp PRP sessions)
   - Finasteride OR Dutasteride (if pharmaceutical track indicated)
   - Oral Minoxidil (if indicated)
9. Records baseline PSA and documents the expected PSA suppression effect for future interpretation
10. Books pharmaceutical monitoring review (6 months)
11. **Does NOT perform the treatment**

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Verification (Each PRP Session)

Before each PRP session, the Practitioner confirms:

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] EMLA prescription on file — valid and current
- [ ] No new contraindications — verbal patient screen (new medications, scalp infection, systemic illness)
- [ ] No active scalp infection, open wounds, or significant inflammatory skin condition at planned treatment sites
- [ ] Baseline photographs on file
- [ ] Today's pre-treatment photographs taken and stored
- [ ] Anticoagulant/antiplatelet status unchanged
- [ ] Sharps bin and clinical waste accessible

**If any item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Contact MD before proceeding.**

---

## 1.9 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT (All Mandatory)

**P-1.** Confirm patient identity and complete Stage 3 checklist.

**P-2.** Take today's standardised pre-treatment photographs (consistent positioning, lighting, and lens distance — match baseline series). Store in digital record.

**P-3.** Discuss any changes in hair loss, medications, or health since last session. If new contraindications identified — STOP. Contact MD.

**P-4.** Room preparation: treatment couch reclined to 45° or patient in barber-style chair with head accessible from all angles, good directional lighting. Sharps bin immediately accessible. Clinical waste positioned.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA APPLICATION (SCALP PRP SESSIONS)

**Step 1.** Confirm EMLA prescription on file. Part the patient's hair in sections to expose the scalp surface across all planned treatment areas.

**Step 2.** Apply EMLA cream (as prescribed by MD) directly to the scalp skin in a generous, uniform layer across all treatment zones (vertex, temporal recession, mid-scalp — per Norwood grade and MD plan). The scalp has a high nerve density; adequate anaesthesia requires thorough application.

**Step 3.** Cover with occlusive film (cling film cut to shape) over each treatment zone. Record application time.

**Step 4.** Wait minimum **60 minutes.** Patient may remain seated during this period.

**Step 5.** Remove film and wipe cream from scalp completely using gauze. Confirm anaesthesia via gentle pin-prick test across each zone. If any zone is inadequate — wait a further 10–15 minutes. Do not inject until adequate anaesthesia is confirmed.

---

### PHASE 2 — SCALP MICRONEEDLING (OPTIONAL — IF MD-PLANNED OR STANDALONE)

> Microneedling may precede PRP injection in the same session (pre-needling enhances PRP penetration), follow it, or be performed as a standalone session.

**Step 6.** Open single-use sterile microneedling cartridge or roller in front of patient (confirm sterile packaging intact).

**Step 7.** Cleanse scalp with chlorhexidine 0.5% or isopropyl alcohol. Allow to dry.

**Step 8.** Apply the device to the treatment zone using light-to-medium pressure. Technique:
- **Dermaroller (0.5–1.0 mm):** Roll in four directions — vertical, horizontal, and bilateral diagonal — 8–10 passes per direction per zone.
- **Electric microneedling pen:** Stamp technique in a grid pattern with slight overlap. Speed: medium. Depth: 0.5–1.0 mm. Do NOT slide the pen laterally while needles are deployed.

**Step 9.** Endpoint: uniform mild erythema across the treated zone. If pinpoint bleeding is seen — reduce pressure. Significant bleeding is not an intended endpoint on the scalp and suggests excessive depth or pressure.

**Step 10.** Wipe scalp gently with sterile gauze. Dispose of needling device into sharps bin immediately. Never reuse.

---

### PHASE 3 — PRP PREPARATION

**Step 11.** Venepuncture — antecubital fossa preferred. Draw blood into ACD-A vacutainer tubes per protocol (typically 16–32 mL whole blood; smaller volume than MEN-CP-001 as scalp treatment requires less PRP than penile treatment).

**Step 12.** Remove tourniquet. Confirm haemostasis. Apply dressing.

**Step 13.** Load tubes into centrifuge. Run validated protocol:
- Spin 1: 1,500 RPM × 5 minutes
- Spin 2: 2,500 RPM × 10 minutes
- (Confirm exact parameters against your centrifuge IFU)

**Step 14.** Extract PRP fraction under aseptic technique into 1 mL syringes (pre-draw into multiple 1 mL syringes for ease of injection). Typical yield: 2–5 mL PRP. Inspect — should be straw-yellow to pale amber. Discard if haemolysed or visually abnormal.

---

### PHASE 4 — PRP INJECTION (NAPPAGE TECHNIQUE)

**Step 15.** Cleanse scalp injection zones with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Allow to fully air dry.

**Step 16.** Attach 30G × 4 mm needle to 1 mL syringe.

**Step 17.** Begin injection using the nappage technique:
- Insert needle bevel-up at a 10–15° angle, targeting the mid-dermis to the subdermal-dermal junction at the level of the hair follicle bulge (depth: 2–3 mm)
- Deposit 0.05–0.1 mL per injection point
- Space injection points approximately 1–1.5 cm apart across the treatment area
- Typical injection point count per session: 50–100 points depending on treatment area size
- Work systematically through each zone: vertex first, then temporal recession, then mid-scalp, then hairline — per MD injection plan

**Step 18.** Aspirate is not strictly required at scalp intradermal depth (vascular anatomy at this depth does not present significant intravascular risk), but Practitioners should pause and reposition if any resistance or unusual swelling pattern is observed.

**Step 19.** Change needle every 20–25 injection points to maintain needle sharpness and minimise patient discomfort (blunt needles cause more tissue trauma and pain).

**Step 20.** After all injection points completed: apply gentle gauze pressure to the scalp surface for 1–2 minutes. Do NOT massage vigorously.

**Step 21.** Dispose of all sharps immediately.

---

### POST-TREATMENT CHECKS

**Step 22.** Observe patient in clinic for minimum **15 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Vasovagal response (pallor, sweating, bradycardia)
- Allergic/anaphylactic reaction (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm — rare; emergency equipment accessible in clinic)
- Haematoma or unusual swelling

**Step 23.** Record in digital app: session number, PRP volume, number of injection points, treatment zones, microneedling performed Y/N, patient response, any adverse events.

**Step 24.** Book next session (4–6 weeks). Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up contact via CRM.

**Step 25.** Provide printed Aftercare Protocol (Part 4).

## 1.10 Pharmaceutical Monitoring Schedule

> The MD reviews all pharmaceutical monitoring results before renewing any prescription.

| Timepoint | Tests | MD Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | FBC, ferritin, TSH, testosterone, PSA (if ≥40 or DHT blocker planned), LFTs, BP | Initiation decision; baseline PSA documented with DHT blocker adjustment note |
| **3 months** | BP + HR (oral minoxidil only); symptom review (sexual side effects, mood) | Medication tolerability; dose adjustment if needed |
| **6 months** | PSA, LFTs, FBC, BP + HR; symptom review | Full pharmaceutical review; PSA compared to baseline (halve result for true comparison if on DHT blocker); continuation confirmed |
| **12 months** | Full repeat of baseline panel; standardised hair photographs | Annual outcome assessment; continuation or substitution decision |
| **Annually thereafter** | As 12-month panel | Annual review |

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Hair Restoration — Scalp PRP ± Microneedling ± Medical Hair Loss Treatment
**Pharmaceutical component prescribed:** _____________________________ (if applicable)
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete and honest information about your hair restoration treatment before agreeing to proceed. You may take time to read it, ask questions, and change your mind about any component of your treatment plan at any time.

---

## 3.2 Scalp PRP — What It Involves

A small volume of your own blood (16–32 mL) is drawn from your arm, centrifuged to concentrate the platelets and growth factors, and injected into the scalp at the level of the hair follicles using a fine needle. Approximately 50–100 injection points are placed per session across the treatment zones. A topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA — a prescription medicine prescribed by the Manchester Medical Director) is applied to the scalp for 60 minutes before injection to reduce discomfort.

A course of 3–6 sessions is needed for an initial response, spaced 4–6 weeks apart. Maintenance sessions (1–2 per year) are required to sustain the effect.

---

## 3.3 Scalp Microneedling — What It Involves

A sterile device with fine needles creates controlled micro-injuries to the scalp surface to stimulate the skin's wound-healing response, increase blood supply to hair follicles, and enhance absorption of PRP. Each needle cartridge or roller is single-use and sterile. Mild redness and sensitivity are expected for 24–48 hours.

---

## 3.4 Medical Hair Loss Treatment — What It Involves

Medical treatment targets the hormonal root cause of male pattern hair loss — the action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on susceptible hair follicles. You have been assessed for one or more of the following:

**Finasteride 1 mg (daily tablet)** — reduces DHT levels in the scalp by approximately 65–70%. Licensed for male pattern hair loss. Shown to halt progression in over 80% of men and produce measurable regrowth in the majority at 2 years.

**Dutasteride 0.5 mg (daily tablet)** — reduces DHT more completely than finasteride (by approximately 90%). Currently used off-label for hair loss in the UK (licensed in other countries). Off-label status means the manufacturer has not sought UK approval for this specific use, though clinical evidence supports its use. This has been disclosed and you accept this.

**Oral Minoxidil (low-dose daily tablet)** — a vasodilator that also promotes hair follicle activity. Off-label for oral use in hair loss. Works through a different mechanism to finasteride/dutasteride and can be combined with them.

---

## 3.5 Sexual Side Effects of Finasteride and Dutasteride — Read This Section Carefully

**This is a mandatory disclosure.** The 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are effective medications. However, they have a documented association with sexual side effects in a subset of men. You must understand these before signing.

**Known side effects (reported in clinical trials — incidence 1–4%):**
- Erectile dysfunction (difficulty achieving or maintaining erections)
- Decreased libido (reduced sex drive)
- Ejaculatory dysfunction (reduced volume, difficulty ejaculating)
- Gynaecomastia (breast tissue development — rare)

**Post-finasteride / post-dutasteride syndrome:**
A smaller subset of men (the exact incidence is debated and under investigation) report persistence of sexual, cognitive, and/or mood symptoms after stopping the medication. This is known as post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). It is not universally accepted as a formal diagnosis but is documented in peer-reviewed literature and acknowledged by regulatory agencies. You are entitled to know this before making your decision.

**Mood and cognitive effects:**
Finasteride and dutasteride have been associated with depressive symptoms, low mood, reduced emotional range, and — rarely — suicidal ideation in a subset of men. If you have a pre-existing mood disorder, this risk is particularly relevant and has been assessed by the MD.

**Given that this clinic also provides treatment for erectile dysfunction:** if you are already experiencing or receiving treatment for any sexual dysfunction at Menhancements, this information is especially relevant to your prescribing decision. Your MD has specifically considered this in your prescription.

**If you experience any of these side effects:** stop the medication and contact the clinic immediately. Do not wait until your next scheduled review. Document when the symptoms started.

---

## 3.6 PSA Effect — Important for Your Health Records

Finasteride reduces your serum PSA level by approximately 50%. Dutasteride reduces it by approximately 50–60%. This means that if you have a PSA test while taking this medication:

- Any PSA result must be doubled to estimate your true PSA for clinical interpretation
- This effect must be communicated to any doctor or healthcare provider requesting a PSA test
- The MD has recorded your baseline PSA before starting this medication precisely for this reason

---

## 3.7 Teratogenicity — If Your Partner May Become Pregnant

Finasteride and dutasteride are harmful to male fetuses. If your partner is pregnant or may become pregnant:
- Do not allow broken or crushed tablets to be handled by her
- Swallow tablets whole and wash hands after handling
- If sexual contact occurs and she may become pregnant — discuss barrier contraception with the MD
- Dutasteride is detectable in semen and can be absorbed by female partners — the MD has assessed this in your case

---

## 3.8 Realistic Outcomes

**PRP:** Evidence supports improvement in hair density, thickness, and shaft calibre — particularly in Norwood Grade II–IV. Results take 3–6 months to appear. Multiple sessions are required. Results are not permanent without ongoing maintenance. PRP does not regrow hair in areas where follicles are completely lost. PRP does not replace pharmaceutical treatment — it works best in combination.

**Medical treatment:** Finasteride and dutasteride halt hair loss in the majority of men and produce visible regrowth in many. They do not restore hair that has already been lost from follicle-dead areas. Long-term continuous use is required. Stopping the medication will result in resumption of hair loss, typically within 6–12 months.

**No specific outcome has been promised or guaranteed.**

---

## 3.9 Alternatives

- Topical minoxidil 5% (available over-the-counter — Regaine for Men)
- Hair transplant surgery (referral available on request)
- No treatment / watchful waiting
- Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) devices — available commercially; limited evidence

---

**Treatment received:** Hair Restoration — Scalp PRP ☐ / Microneedling ☐ / Medical treatment ☐
**Date of treatment:** _____________
**Clinic:** _____________
**Your treating Practitioner:** _____________
**Next PRP session:** _____________ | **Pharmaceutical review:** _____________

## 4.1 What to Expect After Scalp PRP / Microneedling

**Immediately and for 24–48 hours:**
- Scalp redness and mild swelling — expected; resolves within 24–48 hours
- Pinpoint bruising or petechiae across injection sites — expected; resolves within 3–7 days
- Tenderness to touch on the scalp — expected; resolves within 24–48 hours
- Mild headache — common post-scalp injection; managed with paracetamol
- Small crusting at injection points or needling sites — expected; do not pick or scratch

**The shedding phase (weeks 2–6):**
Temporary increased hair shedding (telogen effluvium) can occur 2–6 weeks after a PRP session. This is a normal and expected part of the hair growth cycle response to treatment — the follicle pushes out old hairs to make way for new growth. **This does not mean the treatment has failed.** If shedding is very pronounced or continues beyond 8 weeks — contact the clinic.

**Results timeline:**
- Signs of response: typically 3–6 months post-first session
- Best results: after full induction course (3–6 sessions) + continuation of medical treatment
- Final outcome assessment: 12 months after completing the induction course

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — PRP / Microneedling Sessions

**Scalp washing:**
- Do not wash your hair for **24 hours** after treatment.
- After 24 hours: wash gently with a mild shampoo. Do not vigorously scrub the scalp.

**Products:**
- Do not apply any hair products (gel, wax, hairspray, dry shampoo, minoxidil topical solution) to the scalp for **24 hours** after treatment.
- After 24 hours: resume as normal, including topical minoxidil if you use it.

**Sun exposure:**
- Avoid direct strong sun exposure to the scalp for **48 hours.** Wear a hat if outdoors.
- No sunbeds for **5 days.**

**Heat:**
- No saunas, steam rooms, hot baths, or intense heat to the scalp for **48 hours.**

**Exercise:**
- Avoid vigorous exercise for **24 hours** (sweating on the scalp can irritate the injection sites).
- Light walking is fine.

**Medications:**
- **Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) for 48 hours** — reduces platelet efficacy and increases bruising.
- Paracetamol for any headache or discomfort.

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for **24 hours.**

---

## 4.3 Medical Treatment — Daily Instructions

**Take your prescribed medication every day.** These medications only work while you take them. Stopping — even for a few weeks — begins to reverse the protective effect.

**Finasteride / Dutasteride:**
- Take once daily with or without food at a consistent time
- Swallow the tablet whole — do not crush or break
- Wash hands after handling
- Store out of reach of children and away from women who are or may become pregnant
- **If you miss a dose:** take it when remembered if it is the same day. If the next day, skip the missed dose — do not double dose

**Oral Minoxidil:**
- Take at the same time each day
- If you experience dizziness, palpitations, swelling in your ankles, or unexplained rapid heartbeat — contact the clinic same day or attend A&E if severe
