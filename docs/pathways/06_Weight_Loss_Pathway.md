# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Fat Dissolving Injections — Injectable Lipolysis
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-006 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of injectable lipolysis (fat dissolving injections) at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. The treatment uses a deoxycholic acid-based lipolytic solution (primary product: Aqualyx) injected directly into localised subcutaneous fat deposits to achieve permanent destruction of targeted adipocytes. The lysed fat is subsequently cleared via the lymphatic and macrophage system over 4–12 weeks.

Injectable lipolysis is a body contouring treatment — not a systemic weight loss programme. It targets specific anatomical zones of fat accumulation resistant to diet and exercise: submental fat (double chin), jowls, periumbilical fat, flanks, inner and outer thighs, upper arms, chest fat (including gynaecomastia-type fat), and periarticular knee fat. Patient selection, realistic outcome setting, and anatomical precision are the critical success factors.

**Prescribing model:** Two Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) are required: EMLA cream (topical anaesthetic) and — if MD elects to mix injectable lidocaine with the lipolytic solution for intra-procedural analgesia — injectable lidocaine. Both are prescribed exclusively by the **Manchester Medical Director (MD)**. The lipolytic product itself (Aqualyx) is a UKCA/CE-marked medical device, not a POM, but no treatment session proceeds without confirmed MD prescription for the anaesthetic POMs. The treating Practitioner administers the treatment; the MD prescribes.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — SUBMENTAL ZONE: MARGINAL MANDIBULAR NERVE RISK**
> Injection into the submental and submandibular zones carries a risk of injury to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. Injury produces asymmetric smile and depression of the corner of the mouth. Only Practitioners with documented anatomical competency in the submental zone may treat this area. Injection depth, placement, and product volume must be strictly controlled. See Section 1.9 for zone-specific anatomical guidance.

> **NOTICE 2 — PRODUCT IS NOT REVERSIBLE**
> Unlike hyaluronic acid filler (MEN-CP-003), there is no reversal agent for deoxycholic acid-based lipolysis. Once injected, the adipocyte destruction process is irreversible. Patient selection, zone planning, and injection precision are patient safety matters — not merely aesthetic ones. Over-injection, misplacement, or treatment of an ineligible patient cannot be undone.

> **NOTICE 3 — INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS EXPECTED AND MARKED**
> Significant post-procedure swelling, erythema, and firmness are expected and are a direct consequence of the lipolytic process. Patients must be counselled explicitly before treatment. Failure to prepare patients for this response leads to Grade 2 adverse event reports and avoidable clinic presentations. The consultation form includes a mandatory documented discussion of the expected inflammatory phase.

> **NOTICE 4 — NOT A TREATMENT FOR OBESITY**
> Injectable lipolysis is a focal body contouring treatment. It is not indicated for patients seeking systemic weight loss or for those with diffuse obesity. Patients with BMI >30 kg/m² should be assessed by the MD for suitability — outcomes are less predictable in higher BMI patients, and the risk of irregular results is elevated. Setting this expectation clearly is a clinical governance requirement.

# PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

---

## 1.1 Treatment Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment Name** | Injectable Lipolysis — Fat Dissolving Injections |
| **Primary Product** | Aqualyx (deoxycholic acid 1.25%, phosphatidylcholine — CE/UKCA-marked medical device) |
| **Regulatory Classification** | Medical device (not a POM). Anaesthetic agents (EMLA, injectable lidocaine) are POMs — MD prescription mandatory. |
| **Mechanism** | Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid that disrupts the phospholipid bilayer of adipocyte cell membranes → irreversible adipocyte lysis → release of lipid contents → macrophage phagocytosis and lymphatic clearance over 4–12 weeks |
| **Effect on fat cells** | Permanent. Destroyed adipocytes do not regenerate. Remaining fat cells can still hypertrophy with weight gain — maintenance of results requires stable body weight. |
| **Session Protocol** | Typically 2–6 sessions per zone, spaced 4–6 weeks apart (minimum 4 weeks to allow full clearance from prior session before re-treating) |
| **Results onset** | Visible reduction begins at 4–8 weeks post-session; final result at 12 weeks post-final session |
| **Treatable Zones** | Submental (double chin), jowls, periumbilical abdomen, flanks, inner thighs, outer thighs, upper arms, chest (gynaecomastia-type fat), periarticular knee fat |
| **Not Indicated For** | Visceral fat (inaccessible); diffuse obesity (not appropriate); eyelids or periorbital area (dangerous); breast tissue (contraindicated); over muscle (incorrect plane) |
| **POMs Required** | EMLA cream (MD prescription); Injectable lidocaine (MD prescription — if anaesthetic mixing protocol selected) |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

---

## 1.2 Treatable Zones — Clinical Reference

| Zone | Anatomy Notes | Sessions Typical | Special Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Submental (double chin)** | Superficial subplatysmal fat; pre-platysmal fat | 2–4 | **Marginal mandibular nerve risk** — see Section 1.9. Highest-risk zone. Competency documentation mandatory. |
| **Jowls** | Pre-jowl fat pad; subcutaneous | 2–3 | Facial asymmetry risk; careful depth control |
| **Periumbilical abdomen** | Subcutaneous fat above and below navel | 3–6 | Large volume — multiple vials per session; ensure subcutaneous plane (not intramuscular) |
| **Flanks / love handles** | Lateral truncal fat | 3–5 | Bilaterally symmetrical treatment essential |
| **Inner thighs** | Medial thigh fat pad | 3–5 | Ensure subcutaneous — avoid deep neurovascular structures |
| **Outer thighs** | Lateral thigh fat | 3–5 | |
| **Upper arms** | Posterior arm fat (triceps region) | 2–4 | Avoid radial nerve region — stay superficial and posterior |
| **Chest / gynaecomastia fat** | Subcutaneous fat overlying pectorals | 2–4 | Distinguish lipomastia (fat) from true gynaecomastia (glandular) — glandular gynaecomastia is NOT treatable with lipolysis; MD assessment required |
| **Periarticular knee fat** | Medial and/or lateral knee fat pads | 2–3 | Avoid joint space; superficial plane only |

---

## 1.3 Indications

**Primary Indications:**
- Localised subcutaneous fat deposits resistant to diet and exercise
- Patient with stable body weight (not in active weight-loss phase — results more predictable)
- Submental fat / double chin — primary and best-evidenced indication
- Gynaecomastia-type lipomastia (fat — confirmed NOT glandular) — MD assessment mandatory
- Body contouring — defined focal zones per patient presentation

**Supported Indications:**
- Post-weight-loss residual focal fat pockets
- Fat asymmetry correction (e.g., uneven flanks post-prior treatment elsewhere)

**Not Indicated:**
- Diffuse obesity or patients seeking generalised weight loss
- Patients with BMI > 30 kg/m² — MD assessment required; outcomes less predictable; frank discussion mandatory
- Visceral fat (not accessible)
- Active inflammatory or autoimmune skin conditions overlying treatment zone
- True glandular gynaecomastia (glandular tissue does not respond to lipolysis — refer to endocrinology or surgery)

---

## 1.4 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Active infection, cellulitis, or open wound at the treatment site | Injection into infected tissue — absolute clinical prohibition |
| Active inflammatory skin condition (psoriasis, eczema) at treatment site | Compromised skin integrity; elevated infection risk; unpredictable product behaviour |
| Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of Aqualyx (deoxycholic acid, benzyl alcohol, phosphatidylcholine) | Anaphylaxis and severe inflammatory reaction risk |
| Known allergy to lidocaine or prilocaine — without alternative anaesthetic plan | EMLA cannot be used; alternative plan must be established by MD |
| Lipodystrophy (including HIV-associated) | Lipolysis in abnormal fat distribution is unpredictable and potentially harmful |
| Active autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis with systemic involvement) | Exaggerated and uncontrolled inflammatory response risk |
| Coagulopathy or active anticoagulant therapy without medical clearance | Significant haematoma risk in post-lytic inflammatory phase |
| Liver disease (significant) | Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid; hepatic impairment affects clearance and may intensify systemic exposure |
| Uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia | Lysis of adipocytes releases lipid contents systemically; elevated baseline lipid load increases atherogenic risk during clearance phase |
| Pregnancy | Teratogenicity unknown; absolutely contraindicated |
| Patient under 18 years of age | Not appropriate |
| Patient lacking capacity to consent | Legally prohibited |
| No valid MD prescriptions for EMLA (and lidocaine if applicable) on patient record | Clinical governance absolute stop |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| BMI > 30 kg/m² | MD assessment mandatory; frank expectation discussion; outcomes less predictable and may be irregular; document decision |
| Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy | MD to advise cessation protocol or document informed haematoma risk |
| Diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled) | Elevated infection risk and impaired clearance of lytic byproducts; MD review |
| Significant lymphatic drainage impairment (e.g., post-lymphadenectomy, lymphoedema) | Impaired clearance of lysed material; MD review |
| History of keloid or hypertrophic scarring | Risk of abnormal fibrotic response to lipolytic inflammatory phase; MD assessment |
| Thyroid disease (active, untreated) | Lipolysis may be less effective and response unpredictable; optimise thyroid function first |
| History of significant depressive disorder | Unrealistic expectations may relate to dysmorphic concern; consider psychological review |
| Suspected lipoma at proposed injection site | Lipomas are benign tumours — lipolysis is not an appropriate treatment; refer for surgical assessment |
| True gynaecomastia (glandular component suspected) | MD assessment; ultrasound may be required to distinguish; lipolysis will not treat glandular tissue |

---

## 1.5 Mandatory Baseline Requirements

> Unlike systemic pharmacological pathways, injectable lipolysis does not require a blood investigation panel for standard presentations. The following are mandatory before any treatment session.

| Requirement | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Standardised baseline photography** — minimum 4 angles per treatment zone | Clinical governance; outcome tracking; medico-legal record; mandatory before first session |
| **BMI (calculated, measured weight and height)** | Eligibility assessment; outcome expectation discussion |
| **Contraindication screen** (full, documented) | Safety gate |
| **Targeted zone assessment** — fat pinch test; fat layer thickness confirmed subcutaneous (not intramuscular or visceral) | Confirms treatability of proposed zone; ensures correct injection plane |
| **Informed Consent** signed and on file | Legal and clinical requirement |
| **EMLA prescription on digital record** (MD) | POM compliance gate |
| **Lipid profile** (if clinically indicated — uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia screen; MD to request) | Lysis releases lipid contents; elevated baseline is a contraindication |
| **Gynaecomastia assessment** (if chest zone is proposed) | Distinguish lipomastia (treatable) from glandular gynaecomastia (not treatable with lipolysis); ultrasound referral if uncertain |

## 1.7 Prescribing & Consultation Pathway

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 20–30 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Records presenting concern and specific zones the patient wishes to address
2. Measures weight and height; calculates BMI
3. Assesses each proposed treatment zone — fat pinch test, skin quality, subcutaneous fat thickness; distinguishes from underlying muscle or visceral content
4. Photographs each proposed zone — standardised baseline set (mandatory before any treatment)
5. Completes full medical history and contraindication screen
6. For chest/gynaecomastia: assesses for glandular component — if uncertain, flags for MD assessment and possible ultrasound before proceeding
7. Discusses realistic outcomes per zone and Norwood of fat distribution — documented discussion
8. **Does NOT prescribe any POM**
9. Transmits assessment to MD (required for all new patients; for established patients, the Practitioner may proceed to Stage 3 directly if no new contraindications or new zones are being added)

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation OR in-person (Manchester)
**Required for:** All new patients; any patient with relative contraindications; BMI > 30 kg/m²; proposed submental treatment (due to marginal mandibular nerve risk — Practitioner competency must be confirmed); suspected gynaecomastia; any patient on anticoagulants

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner assessment and baseline photographs
2. Confirms suitability of proposed treatment zones and patient eligibility
3. Reviews contraindication screen; specifically clears anticoagulant status, liver function, hyperlipidaemia, and autoimmune history
4. Confirms Practitioner's anatomical competency for submental zone is on file (if applicable)
5. Reviews BMI; if > 30 kg/m², conducts expectation management discussion and documents
6. Selects anaesthetic protocol (EMLA alone vs. EMLA + injectable lidocaine mixing)
7. Issues written prescriptions:
   - EMLA cream (quantity, application instructions)
   - Injectable lidocaine 2% (if mixing protocol selected — specifies volume per session)
8. Documents treatment zone plan and vial allocation per zone in patient record
9. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Verification (Every Session)

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] EMLA prescription on file — valid
- [ ] Lidocaine prescription on file if mixing protocol in use
- [ ] Product batch number and expiry confirmed — recorded
- [ ] Baseline photographs on file
- [ ] Today's pre-treatment photographs taken and stored
- [ ] No new contraindications — verbal patient screen (new medications, new medical conditions, skin changes at treatment sites)
- [ ] Treatment site inspected — no active infection, no open wounds, no significant inflammatory skin change
- [ ] For submental zone: Practitioner anatomical competency confirmed on file

**If any item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Contact MD before proceeding.**

---

## 1.8 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT

**P-1.** Confirm patient identity and complete Stage 3 checklist.

**P-2.** Take today's standardised pre-treatment photographs. Consistent angle, lighting, and distance — match baseline series exactly. Store in digital record before starting.

**P-3.** Room preparation: patient positioned appropriately per treatment zone (supine for abdomen/thighs; seated semi-reclined for submental; seated for arms). Good directional lighting. Sharps bin immediately accessible.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA APPLICATION

**Step 1.** Confirm EMLA prescription on file.

**Step 2.** Apply EMLA cream generously to the entire planned treatment surface. Cover with occlusive film (cling film). Record application time.

**Step 3.** Wait minimum **60 minutes** (75 minutes preferred for larger body zones). Patient may remain clothed over the film during this period.

**Step 4.** Remove film and wipe cream completely. Confirm anaesthesia with gentle pin-prick test across the treatment zone. Proceed only when adequate surface anaesthesia is confirmed.

---

### PHASE 2 — ZONE MAPPING

**Step 5.** Using a sterile or alcohol-wipeable dermographic marker, draw a precise treatment grid over the prepared zone:
- Submental: standard injection grid 1 cm × 1 cm across the submental fat pad; define upper boundary (1–1.5 cm below the mandibular border), lower boundary (1–1.5 cm above the thyroid notch), and lateral boundaries (mid-sternocleidomastoid)
- Body zones: 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm grid across the entire fat deposit
- Mark grid intersection points as injection sites

**Step 6.** Document the number of mapped injection points and confirm it aligns with the vial allocation per the MD treatment plan.

---

### PHASE 3 — PRODUCT PREPARATION

**Step 7.** Open Aqualyx vials in front of patient. Record batch number and expiry. Inspect solution — clear and colourless.

**Step 8.** Draw up per MD protocol:
- **EMLA-only anaesthetic plan:** Draw Aqualyx directly (undiluted, or diluted per product IFU if large zone).
- **Lidocaine mixing protocol (if MD-prescribed):** Draw Aqualyx into syringe. Add MD-prescribed volume of lidocaine 2% (typically 0.5–1 mL per 8 mL Aqualyx — exact ratio per MD prescription). Mix by gentle inversion — do not shake.

**Step 9.** Label syringes with patient initials, product, zone, and time of preparation.

---

### PHASE 4 — INJECTION DELIVERY

**Step 10.** Cleanse the mapped treatment zone with chlorhexidine 2% in isopropyl alcohol. Allow to fully air dry.

**Step 11.** Begin injection at first grid point. Technique:

| Zone | Needle | Depth | Volume per Point | Technique |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Submental | 27G × 13 mm | 6–10 mm (subdermal — **above the platysma**) | 0.2–0.5 mL | Fanning or grid; controlled slow injection |
| Jowls | 30G × 13 mm | 4–8 mm subdermal | 0.1–0.3 mL | Precise; small deposits |
| Abdomen | 25G × 38 mm | 10–20 mm subcutaneous | 0.5–1.0 mL | Linear retrograde or serial puncture |
| Flanks | 25G × 38 mm | 10–20 mm subcutaneous | 0.5–1.0 mL | As abdomen |
| Thighs | 25G × 38 mm | 10–15 mm subcutaneous | 0.5–1.0 mL | Stay superficial to fascia lata |
| Upper arms | 27G × 25 mm | 8–12 mm subcutaneous | 0.3–0.5 mL | Stay posterior; avoid radial nerve |
| Chest (lipomastia) | 27G × 25 mm | 8–15 mm subcutaneous | 0.3–0.5 mL | Subcutaneous only — avoid glandular tissue and inframammary vessels |
| Knee fat | 27G × 13 mm | 6–10 mm subcutaneous | 0.2–0.3 mL | Superficial; avoid joint capsule |

**Step 12.** At each injection point: insert needle. Aspirate — no blood return confirmed. Inject slowly and steadily. A mild burning sensation is expected and normal. Withdraw needle.

**Step 13.** Move systematically through all grid points. Work from one side to the other consistently to ensure even distribution.

**Step 14.** Dispose of each needle into the sharps bin immediately after use. Never recap or leave needles on the tray.

**Step 15.** After all points injected: apply clean cold pack (wrapped in cloth — not direct skin contact) to the treatment zone for 5 minutes to reduce immediate burning and swelling.

**Step 16.** Record: zones treated, total vials used, injection point count, product batch number, patient response. Enter in digital record.

---

### PHASE 5 — SUBMENTAL ZONE — ADDITIONAL ANATOMICAL PROTOCOL

> This section is mandatory for ALL submental treatments. Read in full.

**Marginal Mandibular Nerve — Anatomy and Avoidance:**

The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) exits the parotid gland, runs inferiorly and anteriorly along the lower border of the mandible, and crosses the mandibular border to innervate the depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris muscles. Injury causes asymmetric smile and depression of the ipsilateral oral commissure, which may be temporary or permanent.

**Mandatory avoidance protocol:**
- **Never inject within 1.5 cm of the inferior mandibular border**
- Mark the mandibular border clearly on the skin before injecting. The upper injection boundary is a line 1.5 cm below the palpated mandibular border.
- Inject superficially in the subdermal plane — above the platysma muscle. Injecting through or below the platysma significantly elevates nerve injury risk.
- Never inject laterally beyond the mid-sternocleidomastoid line in the submental zone.
- Keep volumes per point conservative (0.2–0.3 mL maximum in the submental zone per point).
- If patient reports sudden weakness of the lip or asymmetric facial movement during or after injection — STOP. Document. Call MD. Follow Grade 2 adverse event protocol.

---

### POST-TREATMENT CHECKS (Mandatory Before Discharge)

**Step 17.** Observe patient for minimum **20 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Anaphylaxis (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, tachycardia) — emergency protocol; call 999
- Vasovagal episode — supine position, legs elevated, monitor
- Significant unexpected swelling beyond the expected post-injection erythema
- Any neurological symptom following submental treatment (lip weakness, asymmetric smile, facial drooping) — immediate MD contact

**Step 18.** Verbally review the inflammatory phase expectations with the patient. Ensure they understand what is normal (Section 4.1) vs. what requires urgent contact (Section 4.5). Confirm patient can recall at least two emergency red flags before leaving.

**Step 19.** Provide printed Aftercare Protocol (Part 4).

**Step 20.** Book next session (minimum 4–6 weeks). Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up contact via CRM.

---

## 1.9 Session Spacing — Biological Rationale

**Minimum 4 weeks between sessions in the same zone.** This is not an arbitrary interval — it is based on the biology of adipocyte clearance:
1. Adipocytes are lysed at the time of injection (acute process)
2. Macrophages begin clearing the cellular debris within 24–72 hours
3. Lymphatic drainage of lipid-laden macrophages occurs over 4–8 weeks
4. Fibroblast and collagen remodelling of the treatment zone continues to 12 weeks

Injecting before clearance is complete risks injecting into an already inflamed, incompletely cleared zone — reducing efficacy, elevating inflammatory response, and increasing tissue complication risk.

---

## 1.10 Automated Emergency Escalation Protocol

> Activates for Grade 3+ adverse events. Anaphylaxis triggers immediate 999 call.

### Severity Grading

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade 1** | Expected: erythema, swelling, firm nodularity, burning, tenderness for up to 4 weeks | Document in app. Advise patient. No escalation. |
| **Grade 2** | Moderate: significant haematoma, persistent swelling >4 weeks, suspected nerve effect (mild lip asymmetry), nodule persisting >12 weeks | Document in app. Telephone MD. Record guidance. Possible referral to dermatology or neurology. |
| **Grade 3** | Severe: anaphylaxis, confirmed nerve injury with functional deficit, skin ulceration / necrosis, severe spreading cellulitis | **ACTIVATE FULL ESCALATION PROTOCOL + CALL 999** |

### Skin Necrosis — Recognition and Action

**Signs:** Defined area of pale, grey, or dark discolouration within hours to days of injection; associated pain disproportionate to expected discomfort; blister formation; tissue breakdown.

**Action:** Photograph immediately. Do not apply any topical product. Contact MD same day — urgent. Refer to plastic surgery or dermatology for wound management. Activate escalation protocol.

### Full Escalation Protocol

**Step E-1: Patient Safety**
- **Anaphylaxis:** IM adrenaline 0.5 mg (anterolateral thigh). Call 999. ABCDE.
- **Nerve injury (facial drooping, lip asymmetry):** Document onset time and nature precisely. Photograph if patient consents. Contact MD immediately. Do not dismiss as transient without MD assessment.
- **Skin necrosis / ulceration:** Cover with non-adherent dressing. Contact MD immediately. Refer to wound care.

**Step E-2: Digital Logging**
Log in Menhancements digital app:
- Select: **"Adverse Event Report"**
- Enter: Patient ID, product name and batch number, zones treated, complication type, severity, time of onset, actions taken

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Injectable Lipolysis — Fat Dissolving Injections
**Zone(s) to be treated:** _____________________________
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document provides complete, accurate information about injectable lipolysis before you agree to proceed. Read it in full. Ask questions. You may change your mind at any time before the needle is inserted.

---

## 3.2 What the Treatment Involves

A lipolytic solution (Aqualyx — a CE/UKCA-marked medical device containing deoxycholic acid) is injected directly into the subcutaneous fat in the targeted treatment zone using a fine needle. Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid that disrupts the wall of fat cells, causing them to break down. The resulting cellular debris and fat content are cleared by your immune system (macrophages) over the following weeks.

Before injection, a topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA — prescribed by the Manchester Medical Director) is applied to the skin for 60 minutes. An additional anaesthetic may be mixed directly with the injection solution if your MD has prescribed it.

The injection itself typically takes 20–40 minutes. Multiple sessions are required for a meaningful result.

---

## 3.3 This Treatment Is Irreversible

There is no reversal agent for this treatment. Once deoxycholic acid has lysed the fat cells in the treated area, those cells are permanently destroyed. You cannot undo this. This makes precise zone selection and injection technique a patient safety matter.

Remaining fat cells — in the treated zone and elsewhere — can still grow if you gain weight. Maintaining your result requires weight stability.

---

## 3.4 This Is Not a Weight Loss Treatment

Injectable lipolysis removes localised deposits of subcutaneous fat. It does not affect visceral fat, generalised obesity, or body weight on the scales significantly. If you are seeking general weight loss, this is not the appropriate treatment. This has been discussed and is your understanding.

---

## 3.5 Realistic Outcomes

A meaningful result typically requires 2–6 treatment sessions per zone, spaced at minimum 4 weeks apart. Final results are assessed 12 weeks after the last session in each zone — not immediately after treatment.

The swelling from this treatment is significant (see Section 3.6) and masks the result for 4–12 weeks. You will not see the outcome during this period.

Results are not guaranteed. Variability in individual inflammatory response, lymphatic drainage, and fat distribution means some patients see excellent results and others see limited change.

---

## 3.6 What to Expect — The Inflammatory Phase

This is mandatory information. The inflammatory response to this treatment is expected, normal, and does not indicate a problem unless the warning signs in Section 3.8 are present.

**Immediately after treatment:**
- Redness, burning, and swelling at the injection sites — begins immediately; normal
- The treated area will feel warm

**Days 1–7:**
- Significant swelling — the treated area may swell to 1.5–2 times its pre-treatment size. This is a direct result of the inflammatory response and is expected. For submental treatment, the neck will be visibly swollen. This does NOT reflect the final result.
- Tenderness to touch and pressure
- Possible bruising and haematoma
- Mild to moderate discomfort — managed with paracetamol (not NSAIDs — see aftercare)

**Weeks 2–6:**
- Gradual subsidence of swelling
- The area may feel firm and nodular — this is the macrophage clearance phase, not permanent
- Itching is common as the area heals

**Weeks 6–12:**
- Progressive softening and reduction in treated fat volume
- Final result visible at approximately 12 weeks post-last session

---

## 3.7 Risks and Potential Complications

**Very common (expected):**
- Swelling, redness, warmth, and firmness — see Section 3.6; expected; not a complication
- Bruising and haematoma
- Tenderness and sensitivity for up to 4 weeks
- Temporary nodularity (weeks 2–6)

**Uncommon:**
- Persistent firmness or indurated nodule beyond 12 weeks — may require dermatological review; in most cases resolves with time
- Irregular surface contour — particularly if injection distribution was uneven; may be addressed in subsequent sessions
- Skin pigmentation change at injection sites — usually temporary
- Prolonged swelling beyond expected timeline

**Rare but serious:**
- **Skin necrosis / ulceration** — if product is injected too superficially, it can damage the dermis, causing skin breakdown. This may require specialist wound care. Your Practitioner is trained to ensure correct injection depth.
- **Infection** — rare; presents with increasing redness, heat, pain, and fever beyond 48 hours. Requires antibiotic treatment.
- **Nerve injury (submental zone)** — the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve runs near the chin area. Injury can cause temporary or permanent asymmetry of the lower lip. Your Practitioner follows a strict anatomical safety protocol to minimise this risk.
- **Allergic reaction / anaphylaxis** — rare; emergency medication is held in the clinic.

## 4.1 What to Expect — Normal Inflammatory Phase

**Read this before leaving the clinic.** The inflammatory response to this treatment is intended. It is how the treatment works. What you are about to experience is normal — do not be alarmed unless you see the red flags in Section 4.5.

**Immediately after (hours 1–6):** Redness, burning, swelling, and warmth at the injection sites. Normal.

**Days 1–7:** Significant swelling. The treated area will be noticeably enlarged and tender. For submental treatment — your neck and chin area will be substantially swollen. You may look worse before you look better. This is the treatment working. Do not judge results during this phase.

**Weeks 1–4:** Gradual reduction in swelling. Firmness and lumpiness are normal — this is the clearance phase. The area may itch as healing progresses.

**Weeks 4–12:** Progressive softening and visible reduction in fat volume. Final result is assessed at **12 weeks after your last session**.

**Do not evaluate your result until 12 weeks after your final session.** Photographs will be compared at that point.

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions

**Massage:**
- Begin gentle circular massage over the treated area from **Day 3** onwards. This supports lymphatic clearance and minimises lumpy texture. Massage for 5 minutes, twice daily.
- Do NOT massage on Days 1–2 (skin is too tender and swollen).

**Medications:**
- **Use paracetamol only** for discomfort. Take as directed on the packaging.
- **Avoid NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) for **5 days** — they can reduce the effectiveness of the lipolytic inflammatory process.

**Heat and cold:**
- A cold pack (in a cloth) may be used in the first 6 hours to manage burning and swelling.
- **Avoid saunas, hot tubs, steam rooms, and intense heat** for **5 days** — heat accelerates the inflammatory cascade unpredictably.

**Exercise:**
- Avoid vigorous exercise for **48 hours.**
- Light walking from the next day is fine.
- Normal exercise from Day 3.

**Skincare:**
- Keep the treated area clean. Gentle cleansing from Day 2.
- No exfoliants, acids, retinols, or active skincare products on the treated area for **5 days.**
- Apply SPF 30+ to the treated area if exposed to sun from Day 3 onwards — inflamed skin is more susceptible to pigmentation change.

**Alcohol:**
- Avoid alcohol for **48 hours.** Alcohol increases swelling and bruising.

**Clothing / pressure:**
- Avoid tight clothing or compression garments over the treated area for **48 hours.** After this, light compression (e.g., compression shorts over thigh treatment) can be worn if comfortable and supports lymphatic drainage.

---

## 4.3 Supporting Your Results

- **Maintain stable body weight** throughout your treatment course. The destroyed fat cells are gone permanently, but remaining cells can enlarge with weight gain, reducing visible results.
- **Stay well hydrated** — adequate hydration supports lymphatic clearance of the lysed material.
- **Limit alcohol** — alcohol is calorie-dense and promotes fat retention and systemic inflammation.
- **Continue gentle daily massage** from Day 3 through to Week 6.
- Attend all planned sessions — the full course is needed for the cumulative result.

## 4.5 Emergency Red Flags — Contact Clinic or Seek Urgent Care

🔴 **Increasing redness, heat, and pain beyond 48 hours post-treatment, with or without fever >38°C** — possible infection. Contact the clinic same day. If fever is present — attend A&E or urgent GP.

🔴 **Any area of white, grey, or dark skin discolouration developing within hours to days of injection** — possible skin necrosis. Photograph immediately. Contact the clinic SAME DAY. Do not apply any creams or cover with plasters.

🔴 **Asymmetry of the lower lip, difficulty raising the lip corner, or one-sided facial drooping** — following submental treatment only. Possible nerve effect. Photograph. Contact the clinic same day.

🔴 **Rapidly expanding swelling that continues to grow beyond the first 24 hours at an accelerating rate** — possible significant haematoma. Apply firm manual pressure. Contact the clinic or attend A&E.

🔴 **Rash, throat swelling, difficulty breathing** — anaphylaxis. Call 999 immediately.
