# MENHANCEMENTS CLINIC
## Clinical Pathway: Facial & Aesthetic Dermal Fillers — Hyaluronic Acid & Biostimulator Injections
### Document Reference: MEN-CP-008 | Version: 1.0 | Effective Date: 2026-02-24 | Review Date: 2027-02-24

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document governs the end-to-end clinical delivery of aesthetic dermal filler treatments at Menhancements clinics across Manchester, Leeds, Wilmslow, and Wigan. This pathway covers hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers and biostimulator agents for facial rejuvenation and structural enhancement across all standard aesthetic zones: lips, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, cheeks and midface, tear troughs, jawline and chin, temples, nose (non-surgical rhinoplasty), and dorsal hands.

**This is the highest-risk aesthetic injectable pathway in this clinic group.** The face contains a dense, interconnected arterial network. Intravascular injection — or injection that causes vascular compression — can result in skin necrosis, tissue loss, and, in the glabellar, nasal, and periorbital zones, **permanent loss of vision** through retrograde arterial flow to the ophthalmic artery. This complication has been documented in clinical literature worldwide. It is rare but catastrophic and irreversible if not managed within a narrow critical time window.

**The single most important rule in this pathway:** Hyaluronidase must be prescribed by the Manchester MD, physically present in the treatment room, and drawn up and ready **before any syringe of HA filler is opened**. This is not guidance — it is a patient safety absolute that is treated as an equivalent hard stop to any absolute contraindication.

**Prescribing model:** Three Prescription-Only Medicines (POMs) are required: EMLA cream (topical anaesthetic), injectable lidocaine (for nerve blocks where indicated), and hyaluronidase (emergency reversal). All three are prescribed exclusively by the **Manchester Medical Director (MD)**. Dermal filler products themselves are UKCA/CE-marked medical devices, not POMs — but no filler session proceeds without all MD POM prescriptions confirmed on the patient digital record. The treating Practitioner delivers the treatment; the MD prescribes.

**Male-specific context:** Male facial aesthetics requires structural thinking — jawline, chin, and midface projection; correction of fatigue (tear trough, temple); nose refinement. The aesthetic goal in male patients is hardened architecture, not softened curves. Lip treatment, where appropriate, aims for definition rather than volume. All injection plans must reflect masculine facial geometry.

**CQC Registration Status:** This pathway maps fully to the CQC Single Assessment Framework (2023) and is designed for delivery within a CQC-registered provider context.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICES

> **NOTICE 1 — HYALURONIDASE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND MUST BE IN THE ROOM**
> Hyaluronidase (a POM, prescribed by the Manchester MD) must be physically present in the treatment room and ready to draw up **before the first syringe of HA filler is opened**. If hyaluronidase is not available — treatment does not proceed. No exception. No substitution. No deferral.

> **NOTICE 2 — BLINDNESS RISK — OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION**
> Intravascular injection in the glabellar, nasal dorsum, nasal tip, periorbital, and forehead zones can cause retrograde arterial flow via the supratrochlear, supraorbital, dorsal nasal, or angular arteries into the ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery, resulting in **permanent, irreversible loss of vision**. Immediate, high-dose hyaluronidase and emergency ophthalmology referral represent the only possible intervention. There is no guaranteed reversal. Recognition within seconds and action within minutes is the difference between vision and blindness. Every Practitioner treating any high-risk zone must know the visual occlusion protocol (Section 1.9) before picking up a needle.

> **NOTICE 3 — NON-HA FILLERS (SCULPTRA, RADIESSE) ARE NOT REVERSIBLE**
> Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra) and calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse) cannot be dissolved with hyaluronidase. If these products are used, vascular occlusion management is limited to conservative measures only. The MD must explicitly assess and document the risk-benefit of non-HA products per patient and zone.

> **NOTICE 4 — THREE POM PRESCRIPTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY PREPARATION BEGINS**
> EMLA cream, injectable lidocaine (where nerve block is indicated), and hyaluronidase must each have a valid MD prescription on the patient digital record. All three must be verified before the Practitioner proceeds to reconstitution or product preparation.

> **NOTICE 5 — MALE FACIAL ANATOMY — STRUCTURAL, NOT SOFTENED**
> Male facial filler treatment requires specific injection planning. Male anatomy features stronger bony projections, larger muscles, and thicker overlying tissue. Male aesthetic goals — jawline, chin, midface — are architectural. Lip treatment is subtle and proportionate. The injection patterns, volumes, and product viscosity choices appropriate for female patients are frequently inappropriate for male patients. Female treatment templates must not be applied.

# PART 1: STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

---

## 1.1 Treatment Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment Name** | Facial & Aesthetic Dermal Fillers |
| **Primary Agent** | Hyaluronic acid (HA) cross-linked dermal filler — UKCA/CE-marked medical device |
| **Secondary Agents** | Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra); Calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse) — biostimulators; non-reversible with hyaluronidase |
| **POMs in Pathway** | EMLA cream (POM); Injectable lidocaine (POM — for nerve blocks); Hyaluronidase (POM — emergency reversal) — all MD-prescribed |
| **Mechanism — HA** | Cross-linked HA occupies tissue volume; hygroscopic (attracts water) → volumisation; G' (elastic modulus) varies by product — higher G' for structural zones, lower G' for fine superficial areas |
| **Mechanism — Biostimulators** | PLLA/CaHA: stimulate endogenous collagen production; effect builds over 4–12 weeks; not immediately reversible |
| **Onset of Result** | Immediate (HA); 4–12 weeks (biostimulators — collagen stimulation) |
| **Duration of Effect** | HA: 6–24 months (product and zone-dependent); Biostimulators: 18–24+ months |
| **Reversal** | HA: reversible with hyaluronidase; Non-HA (Sculptra/Radiesse): NOT reversible |
| **2-week check** | Recommended for all patients — early assessment; swelling has subsided but product settling still in progress |
| **4-week review** | Standard outcome assessment — final result visible; top-up or correction if needed |
| **Clinics** | Manchester · Leeds · Wilmslow · Wigan |

## 1.2 Facial Vascular Anatomy — Danger Zones

> Every Practitioner must be competent in facial vascular anatomy before treating any zone. This section is a mandatory reference — not optional background reading.

### High-Risk Zones for Vascular Occlusion and Potential Blindness

| Zone | Key Vessels | Occlusion Consequence | Blindness Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Glabellar / procerus** | Supratrochlear artery, supraorbital artery | Skin necrosis (glabellar), eyelid necrosis | **HIGH — retrograde to ophthalmic artery** |
| **Nasal dorsum / tip / alar** | Dorsal nasal artery, lateral nasal artery, angular artery | Nasal skin necrosis, alar necrosis | **HIGH — anastomoses with ophthalmic artery** |
| **Nasolabial fold** | Angular artery (terminal branch of facial artery) | Skin necrosis of fold, upper lip, cheek | Moderate (angular artery can anastomose with ophthalmic) |
| **Periorbital / tear trough** | Infraorbital artery, angular artery | Periorbital necrosis, eyelid | Moderate-high |
| **Forehead** | Supraorbital artery, supratrochlear artery, frontal branch of superficial temporal | Forehead skin necrosis | **HIGH — direct ophthalmic artery territory** |
| **Temple** | Superficial temporal artery | Temple skin necrosis | Lower (but temporal artery anastomoses documented) |
| **Lips** | Superior labial artery, inferior labial artery | Lip necrosis, oral commissure | Low direct blindness risk; skin necrosis significant |
| **Cheek / midface** | Facial artery branches, infraorbital artery | Cheek necrosis | Moderate via infraorbital |
| **Nasolabial + alar crease junction** | Angular artery at alar base | Alar necrosis, tip necrosis | Moderate-high |

### Anastomotic Pathway to Blindness — Mechanism

The angular artery (terminal branch of the facial artery) and the dorsal nasal artery anastomose with the ophthalmic artery at the medial canthal region. Retrograde arterial flow — driven by injection pressure exceeding arterial pressure — can push filler particles proximally through these anastomoses into the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, and posterior ciliary arteries, causing:

1. **Retinal artery occlusion → ischaemic retinal damage → visual loss**
2. **Posterior ciliary artery occlusion → ischaemic optic neuropathy → visual loss**
3. **Ophthalmic artery occlusion → total visual loss**

The critical time window from arterial occlusion to irreversible retinal damage: **approximately 90 minutes** (analogous to stroke). The practical clinical window for meaningful intervention with hyaluronidase is likely shorter.

### Vascular Safety Rules — Mandatory for All Zones

1. **Use blunt-tip cannula in high-risk zones wherever possible** — reduces probability of intravascular needle placement
2. **Aspirate before every injection with sharp needle** — hold for 5–10 seconds; note: false negatives occur (cannula position, small vessel, mobile vessel); aspiration is a risk-reduction measure, not a guarantee
3. **Inject slowly** — never use rapid bolus injection; slow injection allows earlier recognition of vascular compromise
4. **Small volumes per point** — 0.1–0.2 mL maximum per bolus in high-risk zones; never large-volume bolus near end-arteries
5. **Use the non-dominant thumb to apply counter-pressure** at the supratrochlear/supraorbital foramen when injecting the nasolabial fold or nose — reduces retrograde pressure gradient
6. **Move the needle/cannula constantly during injection** — do not inject at a static position
7. **Ask the patient to report any pain, visual change, or headache immediately** — instruct the patient verbally before injecting each high-risk zone

## 1.3 Licensed Products & Selection Guide

### Hyaluronic Acid Fillers (Reversible)

| Product Range | Manufacturer | Products (Low to High G') | Typical Zone Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Juvederm** | Allergan/AbbVie | Volbella < Volift < Voluma < Volux | Volbella: lips, fine lines; Volift: NLF, marionette; Voluma: cheeks; Volux: jaw, chin |
| **Restylane** | Galderma | Restylane Kysse < Refyne < Defyne < Lyft | Kysse: lips; Refyne: fine NLF; Defyne: deeper NLF; Lyft: cheeks, hands |
| **Belotero** | Merz | Soft < Balance < Intense < Volume | Soft: superficial fine lines; Balance: NLF; Intense: deeper; Volume: cheeks |
| **Teosyal** | Teoxane | RHA 1-4, Puresense range | RHA 1-2: dynamic lines; RHA 3-4: structure |

### Non-HA Biostimulators (NOT reversible with hyaluronidase)

| Product | Type | Mechanism | Duration | Reversal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sculptra** | Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) | Collagen stimulation via inflammatory response | 18–24+ months | NOT reversible |
| **Radiesse** | Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) | Collagen stimulation + immediate volumisation | 12–18 months | NOT reversible with hyaluronidase |

> **If non-HA filler is used:** The vascular occlusion risk remains. The emergency hyaluronidase protocol is still followed — it may have limited effect on the product itself but may help with any concurrent HA present and reduce tissue pressure. Non-HA vascular occlusion management is primarily supportive (hyaluronidase for pressure relief, warm compress, aspirin, GTN patch, emergency referral). The MD must document the decision to use a non-HA product with full off-label and non-reversibility disclosure.

### Product Viscosity Selection Principles (G' = Storage Modulus)

| Zone | Required G' | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Lips, fine perioral lines | Low G' (soft, flexible) | High mobility zone — stiff product feels unnatural and migrates |
| NLF, marionette, tear trough | Medium G' | Some structure needed; moderate mobility |
| Cheeks, midface, temples | Medium-high G' | Structural volumisation; less mobility |
| Jawline, chin, nose (NSR) | High G' (firm, cohesive) | Architectural definition; needs to hold projection |

## 1.4 Treatment Zones, Indications & Male Aesthetic Reference

### Aesthetic Facial Zones

| Zone | Male Aesthetic Goal | Male Volume Guide | Key Risks | Cannula or Needle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lips** | Subtle definition; border clarity; proportion — NOT feminising volume | 0.5–1.0 mL total (conservative) | Superior/inferior labial artery occlusion; lip migration | Cannula preferred; needle for border definition |
| **Nasolabial folds (NLF)** | Reduce depth of shadow; maintain masculine facial structure | 0.5–1.5 mL per side | Angular artery occlusion; skin necrosis | Cannula strongly preferred |
| **Marionette lines** | Lift corner; prevent jowling | 0.5–1.0 mL per side | Facial artery branches | Cannula preferred |
| **Cheeks / midface** | Restore or enhance lateral cheek projection; maintain masculine ogee — wider, more angular | 1.0–2.0 mL per side | Infraorbital artery; facial artery | Cannula strongly preferred |
| **Tear trough / periorbital** | Correct dark hollow; reduce fatigued appearance | 0.5–1.0 mL per side | Infraorbital artery; angular artery; ophthalmic territory | Cannula ONLY — no sharp needle in tear trough |
| **Jawline** | Sharpen mandibular border; improve definition; reduce jowl shadow | 1.0–2.5 mL total | Facial artery along mandible; marginal mandibular nerve | Cannula preferred for body; needle for angle |
| **Chin** | Increase projection; correct receding chin; improve profile balance | 0.5–1.5 mL | Mental artery, inferior labial artery | Needle or cannula; periosteal placement preferred for projection |
| **Temples** | Fill hollow temples; frame the face; correct temporal wasting | 0.5–1.5 mL per side | Superficial temporal artery, temporal branch of facial nerve | Needle at periosteal depth OR cannula; avoid temporal artery |
| **Nose (NSR)** | Straighten dorsum; refine tip; reduce bump shadow; correct deviations | 0.3–0.8 mL total | Dorsal nasal artery; angular artery — **blindness risk** | Needle only (precise placement needed); EXTREME CAUTION |
| **Dorsal hands** | Restore volume; reduce tendon/vein prominence | 1.0–3.0 mL per hand | Dorsal venous network; extensor tendons (avoid) | Cannula ONLY |

---

## 1.5 Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications — TREATMENT MUST NOT PROCEED

| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Hyaluronidase not physically present in the treatment room | Safety absolute — no reversal agent available = no HA filler treatment |
| Known hypersensitivity to HA or any filler component (including streptococcal-derived HA, lidocaine-containing products) | Anaphylaxis and severe inflammatory granuloma risk |
| Known allergy to lidocaine or prilocaine — without MD-approved alternative anaesthetic plan | EMLA and lidocaine block cannot be used; alternative plan must be in place before proceeding |
| Active infection, cold sore (HSV), cellulitis, or open wound at or near any proposed treatment zone | Risk of seeding deep infection and biofilm into filler product |
| Active acne with pustules at treatment site | Introduce Cutibacterium acnes into filler — biofilm and late nodule formation |
| Autoimmune connective tissue disease (SLE, Sjögren's, scleroderma, dermatomyositis) in active flare | Exaggerated, unpredictable inflammatory response; granuloma risk |
| Active inflammatory skin disease (e.g., lichen planus, psoriatic plaques) at treatment site | As above |
| Prior permanent filler at proposed site (silicone, PMMA, polyacrylamide) — unless fully assessed | Permanent fillers behave unpredictably with HA addition; granuloma, migration risk; MD must assess |
| Coagulopathy or active anticoagulant therapy without medical clearance | High bleeding and haematoma risk, particularly at tear trough and periorbital |
| Patient under 18 years of age | Not appropriate; not lawful |
| Patient lacking capacity to consent | Legally prohibited |
| No valid MD prescriptions (EMLA, lidocaine, hyaluronidase) on patient record | Clinical governance absolute stop |

### Relative Contraindications — MD REVIEW REQUIRED

| Contraindication | Action |
|---|---|
| Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy | MD guidance on cessation; document informed bruising/haematoma risk |
| Recent dental procedure or oral surgery (<2 weeks) — if treating perioral zones | Bacteraemia risk; defer periooral filler |
| History of cold sores (HSV-1) at or near treatment site — prophylactic antivirals | MD to prescribe antivirals commencing 48 hours pre-treatment for perioral zones |
| Significant active acne (non-pustular; cystic) at or near treatment site | MD review; caution for perioral and cheek zones |
| History of inflammatory nodules or granuloma from prior HA filler | FLAG: may indicate hypersensitivity; MD to assess; patch test may be indicated |
| History of biofilm infection following prior filler | MD review; biofilm risk is significantly elevated with repeat treatment |
| Diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled, HbA1c >75 mmol/mol) | Elevated infection and impaired healing risk |
| Immunosuppressant therapy | Elevated infection risk; late granuloma risk; MD review |
| Significant BMI (>35 kg/m²) affecting facial anatomy | Results less predictable in highly adipose facial tissue; MD expectation discussion |
| Body dysmorphic disorder — suspected or confirmed | Refer to psychological assessment before any aesthetic treatment; MD assessment mandatory |
| Unrealistic patient expectations | MD/Practitioner discussion; document; may decline to treat |
| Previous significant facial surgery affecting tissue planes | MD assessment; altered anatomy changes product distribution |
| Tear trough — significant orbital fat herniation | Filler in tear trough may worsen the appearance in patients with prominent orbital fat herniation; MD assessment essential |
| NSR (non-surgical rhinoplasty) — history of rhinoplasty surgery | Altered vascular anatomy post-surgery; significantly elevated occlusion risk; MD review; some practitioners decline post-rhinoplasty NSR entirely |

## 1.7 Prescribing & Consultation Pathway

### STAGE 1 — Practitioner Initial Clinical Assessment

**Conducted by:** Treating Practitioner (any clinic location)
**Format:** In-person at clinic
**Duration:** 30–45 minutes

The Practitioner:
1. Records presenting concerns and treatment goals — patient's own words documented
2. Conducts full facial assessment: static and dynamic; symmetry baseline; bony anatomy assessment (particularly jawline, chin, and cheek projections for male structural treatment)
3. Assesses each proposed zone: tissue quality, fat compartments, skin laxity, existing filler, vascular anatomy considerations
4. Identifies baseline asymmetry — must be documented AND disclosed to patient before treatment; confirmed with photographs
5. Takes standardised baseline photographs — mandatory before any treatment (minimum: full face frontal neutral + animated; bilateral lateral; close-up each proposed zone)
6. Screens all contraindications — specifically prior permanent filler, history of inflammatory nodules, recent dental work, HSV history
7. For tear trough: assesses for orbital fat herniation
8. For NSR: assesses for prior rhinoplasty
9. For lip treatment: assesses for HSV history; advises re: antiviral prophylaxis (requires MD prescription)
10. **Does NOT prescribe any POM**
11. **Does NOT open, prepare, or prime any filler or POM**
12. Transmits full assessment to MD

---

### STAGE 2 — Manchester MD Prescribing Consultation

**Conducted by:** Manchester Medical Director
**Format:** Video consultation OR in-person (Manchester)
**Mandatory for:** All new patients; any new zone not previously treated; any patient with relative contraindications; post-rhinoplasty NSR patients (individual MD risk-benefit assessment)

The MD:
1. Reviews Practitioner assessment and baseline photographs
2. Confirms treatment zone suitability and reviews any relative contraindications
3. Confirms Practitioner competency is documented for each proposed zone (particularly NSR, tear trough — highest anatomical risk zones)
4. Reviews male facial anatomy from photographs — confirms treatment plan reflects masculine structural goals
5. Selects filler product(s) per zone — G' grade, brand, volume; documents in treatment plan
6. Determines anaesthetic protocol per zone (EMLA alone; EMLA + topical nerve block; EMLA + injectable nerve block)
7. Discloses off-label status of any product for any zone (most HA filler zones are off-label for specific products)
8. If non-HA product planned: explicitly discloses non-reversibility; documents patient acceptance
9. Issues written prescriptions for all three POMs:
   - EMLA cream
   - Injectable lidocaine 2% (volume, concentration, nerve block protocol)
   - Hyaluronidase (standing emergency prescription — dose protocol: 300–1,500 IU for vascular occlusion; 1,500 IU for visual loss emergency)
10. Documents full treatment plan in patient digital record
11. **Does NOT administer the treatment**

---

### STAGE 3 — Day-of-Treatment Verification (Mandatory Every Session)

- [ ] Patient identity confirmed (name + DOB vs. digital record)
- [ ] EMLA prescription confirmed on record — valid and current
- [ ] Injectable lidocaine prescription confirmed (if nerve block planned)
- [ ] Hyaluronidase prescription confirmed on record — AND physically in treatment room — vials checked, expiry confirmed
- [ ] Filler products confirmed: brand, G' grade, volume per zone — match MD treatment plan
- [ ] Batch numbers and expiry dates confirmed for ALL filler products — recorded in digital system
- [ ] Baseline photographs on file
- [ ] Today's pre-treatment photographs taken
- [ ] Signed Informed Consent on file
- [ ] No new contraindications — verbal screen (new medications, new dental work, cold sore, new medical conditions)
- [ ] Vascular occlusion protocol card visible in room
- [ ] Emergency adrenaline accessible in clinic

**If any item cannot be confirmed → STOP. Do not proceed. Contact MD.**

## 1.8 Step-by-Step Practitioner Protocol

### PRE-TREATMENT

**P-1.** Confirm patient identity and complete Stage 3 checklist. Document completion.

**P-2.** Take today's standardised pre-treatment photographs. Consistent position, lighting, and focal distance vs. baseline. Store before starting.

**P-3.** Review MD treatment plan — zones, products, volumes per zone, anaesthetic protocol. Confirm understanding of injection sequence before opening any product.

**P-4.** Room preparation: treatment couch reclined to 45°, directional lighting optimised, all equipment on sterile field, hyaluronidase confirmed on tray, sharps bin immediately accessible, protocol card visible.

**P-5.** For male patients — confirm treatment goals verbally: "We are aiming for [specific structural goals]. We are not aiming to soften or feminise." Document.

---

### PHASE 1 — EMLA AND ANAESTHETIC

**Step 1.** Confirm EMLA prescription on file. Apply EMLA cream to all planned treatment zones. Apply occlusive film. Record application time.

**Step 2.** Wait minimum **45–60 minutes.**

**Step 3.** Remove EMLA and cleanse skin. Confirm anaesthesia by gentle pin-prick.

**Step 4.** If injectable nerve block is in MD plan:

| Nerve Block | Indication | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| **Infraorbital nerve block** | Midface, NLF, upper lip, cheek, tear trough | 1–2 mL lidocaine 2% injected at infraorbital foramen (1 cm below mid-orbital rim, in line with medial limbus); intraoral or extraoral approach |
| **Mental nerve block** | Lower lip, chin, lower NLF | 1–2 mL lidocaine 2% at mental foramen (between premolars, below mid-tooth root level) |
| **Supraorbital/supratrochlear block** | Forehead, glabellar, brow | 1 mL per nerve, injected at respective foramen along supraorbital rim |

> Allow 5–7 minutes for nerve block to take effect. Confirm anaesthesia before injecting filler.

---

### PHASE 2 — SKIN PREPARATION

**Step 5.** Cleanse the entire treatment area with chlorhexidine 2% in isopropyl alcohol. Allow to fully air dry.

**Step 6.** Mark injection entry points or zone boundaries with dermographic marker where needed (cannula entry ports; NSR planned points; jawline trajectory).

**Step 7.** Apply sterile drape around the treatment field.

---

### PHASE 3 — FILLER INJECTION — ZONE BY ZONE

> Treat zones in sequence: deepest structural zones first (jawline, chin, cheeks), then mid-depth (NLF, marionette, tear trough), then superficial (lips, fine lines). This prevents superficial treatment being displaced by deeper injection pressure.

> **Before each zone:** verbally instruct patient: "I am about to inject [zone]. If you feel any sudden sharp pain, visual change, greyness in your vision, or unusual sensation — tell me immediately and I will stop."

---

#### ZONE A — LIPS

**Products:** Low G' HA (e.g., Juvederm Volbella, Restylane Kysse)
**Anaesthetic:** EMLA + infraorbital and mental nerve blocks recommended

**Male-specific:** Aim for definition of the vermillion border and modest volume. Do NOT over-evert the upper lip. The male upper lip should not protrude beyond the lower lip significantly. Total volume typically 0.5–1.0 mL.

**Injection technique:**
- Dry and re-cleanse lip surface post-EMLA
- Superior labial artery runs in the wet-dry junction or just deep to it — avoid injecting deep in this plane; stay submucosal or at the vermillion border
- Vermillion border: sharp 27G needle, 0.05–0.1 mL per point at the border, retrograde threading
- Body of lip: cannula preferred, deposit in submucosal plane, fan technique

**Aspiration:** Aspirate at every new needle position. If blood — reposition.

---

#### ZONE B — NASOLABIAL FOLDS

**Products:** Medium G' HA (e.g., Juvederm Volift, Restylane Defyne)

**Cannula strongly preferred.** The angular artery runs deep to the NLF along the nasolabial crease and is the primary arterial risk in this zone.

**Injection technique:**
- Single entry point at the superior alar base (above the crease junction)
- Thread cannula in the deep subcutaneous / supraperiosteal plane along the fold
- Retrograde threading — deposit product as cannula is withdrawn
- 0.3–0.5 mL per pass; repeat passes as needed up to planned volume

**Do not inject at the alar crease junction** — highest density of angular artery branches in this zone.

---

#### ZONE C — MARIONETTE LINES / PRE-JOWL

**Products:** Medium G' HA
**Cannula preferred** via inferior entry point at the chin–jaw junction area.

**Technique:** Retrograde threading in deep subcutaneous plane along the marionette line from inferior to superior. 0.3–0.5 mL per side.

---

#### ZONE D — CHEEKS AND MIDFACE

**Products:** Medium-high G' HA (e.g., Juvederm Voluma, Restylane Lyft); or Radiesse (non-reversible — MD must document)

**Male-specific:** Place volume in the lateral cheek — NOT the apple cheek (medial malar eminence). Male cheek projection is lateral and posterosuperior. Medial apple cheek volumisation feminises the face.

**Injection technique:**
- Cannula strongly preferred; entry point at the anterior cheek or zygomatic arch
- Deep placement — supraperiosteal or deep subcutaneous (below the SMAS where possible)
- Bolus deposits at the malar eminence and lateral cheek; fan distribution
- 0.5–1.0 mL bolus per deposit point; total per side typically 1.0–2.0 mL

---

#### ZONE E — TEAR TROUGH AND PERIORBITAL

**CANNULA ONLY — NO SHARP NEEDLE IN THE TEAR TROUGH**

**Products:** Low-medium G' HA (high G' creates Tyndall effect and palpable lump); some practitioners use Restylane or Belotero Balance specifically

**Highest combined risk zone in facial aesthetics after nose:** infraorbital and angular artery territory; close proximity to orbital structures.

**Injection technique:**
- Entry point: medial cheek, 1 cm below the orbital rim
- Advance cannula in the sub-orbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) plane or deep submuscular plane
- Deposit product medially to laterally in small aliquots — 0.05–0.1 mL per deposit
- Total per side: typically 0.3–0.7 mL maximum — under-correction is preferable to over-correction in this zone
- Mould gently after deposition to distribute evenly

**Warning:** Oedema in this zone resolves slowly. Results are not final at 2 weeks. Final assessment at 4–6 weeks.

**Absolute rule:** If at any point during tear trough treatment the patient reports any visual change, greyness, pain around the eye, or sudden headache — STOP immediately. Follow the visual occlusion protocol in Section 1.9.

---

#### ZONE F — JAWLINE

**Products:** High G' HA (e.g., Juvederm Volux, Restylane Defyne/Lyft); or Radiesse

**Male-specific:** Sharpen the mandibular border from angle to chin. Target the anterior-inferior mandibular border and the mandibular angle. A strong jawline is the most requested male structural filler treatment.

**Injection technique:**
- Multiple entry points along the mandibular border
- Deep placement — periosteal or supraperiosteal (on the bone, subperiosteal pocket)
- For mandibular angle: perpendicular needle placement to bone; periosteal injection
- For body of jaw: cannula along the inferior mandibular border

**Risk:** Facial artery crosses the mandibular border at the anterior edge of the masseter — avoid this point.

---

#### ZONE G — CHIN

**Products:** High G' HA (e.g., Volux); or Radiesse

**Technique:** Central bolus injection at the periosteal level. 27–30G needle perpendicular to bone. Aspirate. Inject slowly onto the periosteum. Mould externally into desired projection.

**Risk:** Mental artery and nerve exit the mental foramen bilaterally. Stay central and deep (periosteal). Avoid lateral perimental injection unless MD-directed.

---

#### ZONE H — TEMPLES

**Products:** Medium G' HA; or Radiesse (MD to specify)

**Two injection planes:**
- Periosteal (on bone, between bone and temporalis muscle) — deep plane; lower risk
- Superficial temporal subcutaneous — more superficial; closer to superficial temporal artery and temporal branch of facial nerve

**Technique:** Needle or cannula. If needle — aspirate at each point. Superficial temporal artery runs vertically in the temporal hairline — palpate or map before injecting. Deposit in small aliquots (0.1–0.2 mL per point) to avoid compression of the artery.

---

#### ZONE I — NON-SURGICAL RHINOPLASTY (NSR)

**HIGHEST RISK ZONE IN FACIAL AESTHETICS — BLINDNESS RISK**

**Mandatory prerequisites:**
- Practitioner competency in NSR with documented training — on file before treating
- MD to confirm competency on file at prescribing consultation
- Patient has no history of rhinoplasty — if post-rhinoplasty, MD must individually assess (many practitioners decline post-rhinoplasty NSR)
- Hyaluronidase must be drawn up and ready on the tray before touching the nose

**Products:** High G' HA for structural nose; low G' for fine tip work

**Injection technique:**
- Use fine sharp needle (30G × 13 mm or 27G × 13 mm)
- Periosteal / supraperiosteal plane for dorsal augmentation (on the bone)
- Small volumes per point — maximum 0.1 mL per bolus
- Move needle between each bolus — never accumulate volume at one static point
- Dorsal hump reduction (camouflage): inject above the hump to level the profile — periosteal
- Tip work: subdermal; minimal volumes (0.05 mL per point maximum); extreme caution
- Apply counter-pressure with thumb at the supratrochlear region during nasal injection to reduce retrograde arterial pressure gradient

**Instruct patient** before every injection point: "Tell me immediately if you see any greyness, flashing, or change in your vision. I will stop instantly."

**Post-injection:** Inspect the overlying skin after each injection point — any blanching = STOP IMMEDIATELY → vascular occlusion protocol (Section 1.9).

---

#### ZONE J — DORSAL HANDS

**Products:** Medium G' HA (e.g., Restylane Lyft); or Radiesse

**Technique:** Cannula ONLY — the dorsal hand has a dense superficial venous network; sharp needle risks haematoma.
- Entry point: lateral dorsal hand (ulnar side)
- Advance cannula in the deep subcutaneous plane (above the extensor tendons — do NOT inject into tendon sheaths)
- Fan distribution across the dorsal surface; 0.5–1.0 mL per pass

---

### POST-INJECTION (ALL ZONES — MANDATORY)

**Step 6.** After all zones completed: inspect all treatment areas — skin colour, capillary refill, symmetry. Any blanching or mottling → immediate vascular occlusion protocol.

**Step 7.** Apply cold pack (cloth-wrapped) to reduce swelling.

**Step 8.** Observe patient for minimum **30 minutes** post-injection. Monitor for:
- Signs of vascular compromise (blanching, mottling, dark discolouration — see Section 1.9)
- Allergic / anaphylactic reaction
- Visual symptoms — ask patient at 15 minutes and 30 minutes: "Any change in your vision? Any greyness or blurring?"
- Vasovagal response

**Step 9.** Complete digital record: all products, batch numbers, volumes per zone, entry points, patient response, adverse events.

**Step 10.** Book 2-week check and 4-week review. Trigger automated 48-hour follow-up contact.

**Step 11.** Issue Aftercare Protocol (Part 4). Verbally review visual and vascular emergency signs before patient leaves. Patient must be able to recall what visual symptoms to report.

---

## 1.9 Vascular Occlusion Emergency Protocol — Including Visual Loss

> **This protocol is time-critical. Seconds matter for visual occlusion. Minutes matter for skin necrosis. Know this protocol before you inject.**

### Recognition — Signs by Category

**Skin vascular occlusion:**
| Sign | Timing | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Blanching (white area) | During or immediately post-injection | Arterial occlusion or vasospasm — act immediately |
| Mottling / livedo reticularis | Minutes to hours post-injection | Venous occlusion or developing arterial compromise |
| Cyanosis / grey-blue discolouration | Minutes to hours | Progressing ischaemia |
| Severe disproportionate pain | During or post-injection | May indicate intravascular injection or ischaemia |
| Dark discolouration / black tissue | Hours to days | Late necrosis — seek urgent specialist input |

**Ocular / Visual Occlusion:**
| Sign | Timing | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Sudden visual loss or greying | During or within seconds/minutes of injection | **OPHTHALMIC EMERGENCY — ACT WITHIN SECONDS** |
| Flashing lights or floaters | During injection | Retinal involvement — STOP NOW |
| Eye pain | During or after injection | Possible orbital ischaemia |
| Ptosis or periorbital swelling | Post-injection | Possible orbital fat or vascular involvement |
| Diplopia | Post-injection | Extra-ocular muscle involvement — emergency |

---

### Skin Vascular Occlusion Protocol

**V-1. STOP ALL INJECTION IMMEDIATELY.**

**V-2. Reconstitute and draw up hyaluronidase NOW** (if not already drawn up):
- Reconstitute Hyalase 1,500 IU in 1 mL 0.9% saline = 1,500 IU/mL
- Draw into 1 mL syringe

**V-3. Call MD emergency line simultaneously** — describe: zone injected, product, blanching location, size, and onset.

**V-4. Inject hyaluronidase** into and generously around the entire affected zone:
- Fan it widely — hyaluronidase must reach the filler wherever it has distributed
- Initial dose: **1,500 IU** (1 mL) across the affected area
- Use multiple injection points; massage gently after each injection to distribute
- Do not be conservative — underdosing hyaluronidase is a greater risk than overdosing

**V-5. Reassess** tissue colour and capillary refill every 5–10 minutes.

**V-6. If no improvement within 60 minutes:** repeat hyaluronidase (1,500 IU), call 999, and follow the emergency escalation protocol (Section 1.10).

**V-7. Additional supportive measures (per MD guidance):**
- Warm compress to the affected area (vasodilation)
- Topical GTN 2% paste (if available and MD-directed) — vasodilation
- Aspirin 300 mg oral (if no contraindication and MD directs) — antiplatelet

**V-8. Do not discharge the patient** until perfusion is confirmed normal and MD has given clearance.

---

### Visual Loss / Ophthalmic Occlusion Protocol

> **This is a true emergency. The time window for intervention is measured in minutes. Do not delay for paperwork, phone calls, or photographs.**

**OC-1. STOP ALL INJECTION IMMEDIATELY. Put down the needle/syringe.**

**OC-2. Call 999 immediately.** State: "Patient has suspected ophthalmic artery occlusion following facial filler injection. Possible retinal artery occlusion. Patient is experiencing [visual loss / visual change]. We need an emergency ophthalmology response."

**OC-3. Reconstitute and inject hyaluronidase — high dose, peri-ocular:**
- 300–1,500 IU hyaluronidase injected immediately into the periorbital area on the affected side:
  - Sub-brow injection (supraorbital region)
  - Medial canthal region
  - Periorbital fat
- Some guidance supports retrobulbar injection (1,500 IU into the retrobulbar space) — only if Practitioner is trained and MD directs; call MD before attempting retrobulbar injection

**OC-4. Additional immediate measures (simultaneously, while waiting for 999):**
- Ocular massage: firm, intermittent pressure on the globe to dislodge filler particles and reduce intraocular pressure — press and release rhythm
- Position: seated upright
- Do NOT leave the patient alone
- If available and not contraindicated: Aspirin 300 mg oral

**OC-5. Call MD emergency line immediately** — simultaneously with 999 where possible. MD to provide live guidance on hyaluronidase dosing and additional measures.

**OC-6. Prepare for emergency transport.** Patient must go directly to the nearest ophthalmology emergency unit or A&E with ophthalmology cover. Do not allow patient to drive. Travel with patient if possible; ensure the receiving team knows the cause.

**OC-7. Document everything** in real time or immediately afterwards: product injected, zone, volume, onset of visual symptoms, all actions taken, times. This information is critical for the receiving ophthalmologist.

**OC-8. Activate full escalation protocol** (Section 1.10) simultaneously.

# PART 3: INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT

---

**Patient Name:** _____________________________ **DOB:** _____________
**Treatment:** Aesthetic Dermal Filler
**Product(s) / Zone(s):** _____________________________
**Clinic:** _____________________________ **Date of Consent:** _____________

---

## 3.1 Purpose of This Document

This document ensures you have received complete, honest information about dermal filler treatment. Read it in full. Ask questions. Withdraw consent at any time before the needle is inserted.

---

## 3.2 What the Treatment Involves

Dermal filler is a gel-like substance injected beneath the skin using a fine needle or blunt-tipped cannula to add volume, restore structure, or smooth contours in the targeted zone(s). The primary product used is hyaluronic acid (HA) — a naturally occurring sugar found in the body.

A topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA — prescription medicine prescribed by the Manchester Medical Director) is applied beforehand. For some zones, an additional injectable nerve block (also a prescription medicine) may be used to enhance comfort.

The procedure takes 30–60 minutes depending on the number of zones treated.

---

## 3.3 Prescription Medicines Used

- **EMLA cream** (topical anaesthetic) — prescribed by Manchester MD
- **Injectable lidocaine** (for nerve block if required) — prescribed by Manchester MD
- **Hyaluronidase** — an enzyme that dissolves HA filler; held in the treatment room at all times and used in a vascular emergency

---

## 3.4 Off-Label Use

Most aesthetic filler zones are off-label uses of the specific products. Off-label prescribing by a qualified doctor is lawful in the UK when clinically justified. The Manchester MD has assessed this in your case. You have the right to ask for further information.

---

## 3.5 Realistic Outcomes

Results vary. Volume augmentation, structural definition, and shadow reduction are achievable in well-selected patients. However:
- Asymmetry is possible and may require correction
- Swelling masks the true result for 1–2 weeks; final result is assessed at 4 weeks
- Duration: 6–24 months depending on product and zone; repeat treatment required
- Results are not guaranteed

---

## 3.6 Reversibility

**HA filler is reversible** with hyaluronidase. Complete reversal is not guaranteed — some product may remain, and reversal may require multiple sessions.

**Non-HA fillers (Sculptra, Radiesse) are NOT reversible** with hyaluronidase. If a non-HA product is planned for you today, this has been specifically discussed and you accept this.

Non-HA product planned: ☐ Yes (product: _______) — patient confirms non-reversibility disclosed: _____ ☐ No

---

## 3.7 Risks and Potential Complications

**Common (expected and temporary):**
- Bruising, swelling, tenderness — resolves within 1–2 weeks
- Temporary firmness at injection points — softens within weeks
- Asymmetry in early healing phase

**Uncommon:**
- Haematoma (blood collection) — may require medical drainage
- Tyndall effect (blue-grey skin discolouration from superficial HA placement) — may require hyaluronidase treatment
- Nodule or lumpiness persisting beyond 6 weeks — may require hyaluronidase or medical management
- Delayed inflammatory reaction or granuloma — requires medical treatment
- Biofilm infection — subacute infection around filler; may require antibiotic treatment and dissolution

**Rare but serious:**
- **Vascular occlusion — skin necrosis:** If filler blocks a blood vessel, the skin supplied by that vessel may lose circulation, causing tissue damage and, if untreated, necrosis (death of tissue). Hyaluronidase is used immediately if this occurs. Protocol is in place at every clinic. Permanent scarring or tissue loss is possible even with immediate management.
- **Vascular occlusion — visual loss or blindness:** In zones near the nose, glabellar, and periorbital areas, filler can in rare cases travel through arterial anastomoses to the ophthalmic artery, causing loss of vision. This is a rare but potentially permanent complication. Immediate action with hyaluronidase and emergency ophthalmology is required. There is no guaranteed reversal for visual loss. You must report any change in vision during or after treatment immediately.
- **Allergic reaction / anaphylaxis** — rare; emergency medication is held in the clinic
- **Infection** — rare; may require antibiotic treatment

---

## 3.8 Visual Symptoms — Your Responsibility to Report Immediately

If at any point during or after treatment you experience:
- Sudden greyness, blurring, or loss of vision in either eye
- Flashing lights or floaters
- Pain around or behind the eye

**Tell your Practitioner immediately if in clinic. If you have left clinic — call 999. Tell them you have had facial filler and are experiencing visual symptoms.**

---

## 3.9 Consent Declarations

By signing below, you confirm:

☐ I have read and understood this document or it has been explained to me in full.
☐ I have had the opportunity to ask questions and am satisfied with the answers.
☐ I understand HA filler is reversible with hyaluronidase and that non-HA filler (if applicable) is NOT reversible — and I accept this.

**Patient Copy — Keep This Document**

**Treatment received:** Dermal Filler
**Zone(s) treated:** _____________
**Product(s) used:** _____________
**Date of treatment:** _____________
**Clinic:** _____________ **Practitioner:** _____________
**2-week check:** _____________ | **4-week review:** _____________

---

## 4.1 What to Expect

**Immediately (hours 0–6):**
- Swelling, redness, and mild bruising at injection sites — normal
- The treated area will appear overfilled immediately — do not judge the result yet
- Possible minor lumps or firmness — normal; most settle within days

**Days 1–7:**
- Swelling peaks at 24–48 hours then begins to subside
- Bruising develops and resolves over 7–14 days
- The area may feel firm — this is normal

**Weeks 1–4:**
- Swelling resolves progressively
- Filler integrates with surrounding tissue and softens
- **Do not assess your result until 4 weeks** — swelling significantly distorts the early appearance

**Tear trough:** Oedema in the periorbital region is slow to resolve. Do not assess tear trough results until **6 weeks** post-treatment.

**At your 4-week review:**
- Final result is assessed and photographed
- Minor asymmetry or under-correction may be addressed at this appointment

---

## 4.2 Mandatory Instructions — First 24 Hours

**Do not massage:** Do NOT press, rub, or massage any treated area for **24 hours.** After 24 hours, gentle finger-tip massage is acceptable if instructed by your Practitioner.

**Stay upright:** Avoid lying flat or applying sustained pressure to the treated area for **4 hours** post-treatment.

**No heat:** Avoid saunas, steam rooms, hot baths, or exercise that significantly raises your body temperature for **24 hours.**

**No exercise:** Avoid vigorous exercise for **24 hours** (increases swelling and bruising via vasodilation).

**No alcohol:** Avoid for **24 hours** (increases bruising and vasodilation).

**Skincare:** No exfoliants, retinols, acids, or active skincare products on the treated area for **24 hours.** Gentle cleansing after 6 hours is fine. Sunscreen from Day 2.

**Makeup:** May be gently applied after **6 hours** — use a patting/pressing motion, not rubbing.

**Flying:** Avoid long-haul flights for **24 hours** (cabin pressure and dehydration can affect tissue swelling).

---

## 4.3 Lips — Additional Instructions (if lips were treated)

- Avoid kissing, extreme lip movements, and drinking from small-mouthed bottles for **24 hours**
- No dental treatment for **2 weeks** after lip filler
- If you develop a cold sore at any point post-treatment — contact the clinic. Do not apply over-the-counter cold sore treatments to the injection sites without speaking to us first

---

## 4.4 Hands — Additional Instructions (if hand treatment)

- Avoid heavy gripping or repetitive hand use for **24 hours**
- Normal use from the next day

---

## 4.5 Emergency Red Flags — Act Immediately

🔴 **Any change in your vision — greyness, blurring, loss of vision, flashing lights** — this may indicate a vascular occlusion affecting the eye. **Call 999 immediately.** Tell them you have had facial filler and are experiencing visual symptoms. Contact the clinic simultaneously.

🔴 **A white, pale, or grey area of skin** appearing at or near the treatment zone — possible vascular occlusion. **Call the clinic immediately.** If out of hours, attend A&E. Tell them you have had dermal filler.

🔴 **Dark purple, blue, or black discolouration** of skin developing after treatment — late ischaemia. **Call 999 or go to A&E immediately.**

🔴 **Severe, disproportionate pain** beyond the expected post-procedure discomfort — possible vascular involvement. Contact the clinic same day; go to A&E if pain is severe and escalating.
